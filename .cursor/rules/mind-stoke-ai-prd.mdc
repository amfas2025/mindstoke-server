# Mind Stoke â€“ Phase 1 Product Requirements Document (PRD)
**Version**: 0.1  
**Created by**: Jeff Stoker  
**Last updated**: May 24, 2025  
**Target Completion**: Late July 2025  

---

## 1. Overview

Mind Stoke is an internal-use platform designed for AMFAS staff to intake client data (labs, health history, and cognitive assessments), extract key information, and generate a personalized PDF Roadmap for brain and body health optimization.

---

## 2. Phase 1 Goals

- Allow AMFAS staff to upload labs and auto-extract data
- Store structured HHQ responses from clients via dynamic links
- Upload and extract cognitive assessment data (CNS or MoCA)
- Generate a personalized Roadmap PDF once all three inputs are complete
- Save all client data historically in Supabase
- No client or practitioner access required at this stage

---

## 3. Users

**Internal AMFAS staff only**

All logged-in staff can:
- View and manage client records
- Upload labs
- Upload cognitive assessments
- Confirm HHQ completion
- Trigger/download Roadmaps

---

## 4. Client Record Creation

Client records are created automatically via Zapier when a protocol is purchased via the AMFAS website. Fields to capture in Supabase:

- Full name
- Email
- Phone number
- Date of birth
- Address
- Assessment status
- Assessment type
- Cognitive test uploads (CNS or MoCA)

---

## 5. Lab Upload

- PDF upload via drag-and-drop or file selector
- Data extracted from LabCorp reports using existing extraction logic
- Extracted values stored in Supabase, tied to client ID
- Triggers: No Roadmap generation until HHQ and cognitive test are also completed

---

## 6. Health History Questionnaire (HHQ)

- Clients receive a dynamic link to complete their HHQ
- No login required
- Responses stored as structured tags in Supabase (e.g., `hh-brain_fog`)
- Roadmap logic uses tags; no admin override or summary required in Phase 1

---

## 7. Cognitive Assessment

### CNS Vital Signs:
- PDF uploaded by staff
- Extract domains: Patient Score, Standard Score, Percentile, Validity Indicator, Category
- 15 domains stored per test
- Stored historically in Supabase

### MoCA:
- PDF uploaded by staff
- Store MoCA score (e.g. 24/30)
- Store date and uploaded_by
- No special Roadmap logic differences from CNS

---

## 8. Roadmap Generation

- Automatically or manually triggered **only when labs + HHQ + cognitive test are present**
- Output: Downloadable PDF stored in Supabase under the client record
- Staff manually sends PDF to client via email or Circle
- Roadmap includes optional screenshot (manually added) of cognitive test

---

## 9. Authentication

- Internal user login for AMFAS staff only
- No client or external practitioner logins required in Phase 1

---

## 10. Data Storage & History

- All assessments (labs, HHQ, cognitive) stored historically in Supabase
- Roadmap PDF also saved to Supabase for future reference
- No overwriting of past assessments

---

## 11. Out of Scope (Future Phases)

- Client login portal
- Emailing Roadmap directly from system
- Practitioner dashboards
- AI explanation of Roadmaps
- Trends tracking
- CNS API integration
- Automated SMS/email reminders
