{{hormone_replacement_therapy_consideration}}
There is a particularly good argument for you to consider the use of {{hormone_replacement_therapy_yellow}}. Sex hormones associated with {{reproductive_sexual_health}} and {{sexual_health_cognitive_brain}}, but they are also essential for {{cognitive_brain_health}}. {{estradiol_receptors_body_brain}} receptors are located on {{every_cell_body_brain}}. When {{estradiol_levels_optimized}} levels are optimized, {{cognitive_health_improves}}. Androgens like {{testosterone_anti_inflammatory}} have {{anti_inflammatory_mood_boosting}} benefits and may lessen {{brain_fog_progesterone}}. {{progesterone_neurologically_active}} is very {{neurologically_active_help_balance}} and can help balance {{estrogen_dominance_sleeping_patterns}}, improve {{sleeping_patterns_calm_anxiety}}, and {{calm_anxiety_reasons}}. There are {{several_reasons_hormone_replacement}} you may consider the use of {{hormone_replacement_therapy_hrt}}. Please refer to {{enhance_protocol_guidebook_hrt}} and its {{potential_role_optimizing_health}}.

Though you may have used {{hormone_replacement_past}} in the past, or you may be using {{hormone_replacement_currently}}, your {{current_hormone_levels_optimal}} may still not be considered {{optimal_cognitive_health}}. Please refer to the {{hormone_replacement_section_guidebook}} and {{schedule_consultation_primary_care}} with your {{primary_care_provider_opportunities}} to {{talk_opportunities_optimize_hrt}}.

{{breast_cancer_history_protocols}}
**{{quick_breast_ca_consideration}}** You have reported a {{personal_history_breast_cancer}}. {{traditional_medicine_hormone_optimization}} suggests {{hormone_optimization_contraindicated}} now {{questions_challenging_position}}. Many {{women_personal_history_embracing}} with a {{personal_history_breast_cancer}} are {{embracing_hormone_optimization_context}} especially in the {{context_progesterone_optimization}}. {{memory_health_quality_life_optimization}} should {{only_done_after_thoughtful}} be done only after {{thoughtful_consideration_enhance_protocol}} More information can be found in {{enhance_protocol_guidebook_quick_breast_ca}}.

{{progesterone_insomnia_anxiety_protocols}}
**{{breastca_insomnia_anxiety_consideration}}** {{progesterone_optimization_insomnia_anxiety}} optimization is an {{amazing_way_improve_insomnia}} to improve {{insomnia_calm_anxiety}}. {{progesterone_used_clinical_trials}} has also been used in {{many_clinical_trials_concussion}} for those with a {{history_concussion_tbi}} because of its {{calming_influence_brain}}. You have reported a {{history_breast_cancer_hormone}} breast cancer. {{hormone_optimization_initiated_thoughtful}} should only be initiated after {{thoughtful_consideration_historical_breast}} of your {{historical_breast_cancer_informed_consent}} breast cancer. {{informed_consent_required_treatment}} is required before {{treatment_initiated_telemedicine_consultation}}. {{consider_telemedicine_consultation_risks_benefits}}.

{{depression_anxiety_hormone_protocols}}
**{{quick_depression_mood_disorder}}** In your {{health_history_identified_challenges}} you provided, you identified {{challenges_depression_anxiety}}. {{hormone_optimization_fantastic_address}} is a fantastic way to address {{anxiety_major_factor_decision}} This may be a {{major_factor_decision_hormone}} in your decision about {{hormone_optimization_quick_hormone_mood}}.

{{insomnia_sleep_optimization}}
**{{prodrome_sleep_consideration}}** In your {{health_history_identified_history}} you identified a {{history_insomnia_taking_prescription}} for which you are taking a {{prescription_medication_help_sleep}}. It is a {{very_safe_neurologically_active}} neurologically active hormone that {{helps_promote_improved_sleep}}.

Your baseline {{total_testosterone_status}} level was {{mh1_tt_lab_value}} ng/dL, and {{optimal_level_suggested_closer}} is suggested to be closer to {{700_ng_dl_testosterone}}.

Your baseline {{free_testosterone_status}} level was reported as {{mh1_free_t_lab_value}} ng/mL. {{regardless_normal_values_posted}} of the 'normal' values posted on your {{lab_result_free_testosterone_male}}. If your {{total_testosterone_5_normal}} is normal, but your {{active_testosterone_low_experience}} TESTOSTERONE is low, you will likely experience {{some_symptoms_low_t}}. You want your {{free_testosterone_level_50_75}} level to be at the {{50_75_percentile_normal}}. The {{normal_range_6_18}} range is {{6_18_pg_ml_optimal_range}}. Therefore, the {{optimal_range_12_15_pg_ml}}.

Your baseline {{sex_hormone_binding_globulin_male}} level was {{mh1_shbg_lab_value}}. We believe the {{optimal_range_shbg_45}} to be < {{45_pg_ml_shbg}}.

Your baseline {{psa_level_status}} was {{lab_psa_value}} and we believe the {{optimal_range_psa_4_0}}.
