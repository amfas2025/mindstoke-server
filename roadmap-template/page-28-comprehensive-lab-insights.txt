There may be other {{risk_factors_identified_lab}} identified in your {{lab_work_factored_efforts}} that should be {{factored_efforts_improve_brain}}. We have {{summarized_risk_factors_below}}.

## **Blood Counts and Risk for Anemia**

As a part of our {{testing_completed_complete_blood}} we completed a {{complete_blood_count_red_blood}}. Your {{red_blood_cell_rbc_status}} ({{rbc_status}}) was {{roadmap_cbc_rbc_value}}, your {{hemoglobin_status}} was {{roadmap_cbc_hgb_value}}, your {{hematocrit_status}} was {{roadmap_cbc_hct_value}}, and your {{platelet_count_status}} was {{cbc_plt_value}}. {{these_markers_fall_optimal}} and {{optimal_parameters_intervention_recommended_blood_counts}}.

{{quick_anemia_consideration}}
At least one of {{these_variables_suggestive_trending}} may be suggestive that {{you_trending_towards_anemia}} This puts the {{brain_risk_limiting_delivery}} at risk by {{limiting_delivery_oxygen_brain}}.

Your {{mcv_condition_macrocytosis}} is a condition called {{macrocytosis_status}} was elevated. The {{elevated_mcv_level_related}} level may be {{related_use_alcohol_indicate}} to the use of {{alcohol_indicate_stomach_related}} or it may indicate you have {{stomach_related_challenges_acid_reflux}} like {{acid_reflux_related_other_factors}}. However, it may also be {{related_other_factors_contributors}} to {{other_factors_contributors_medical}} One of our {{medical_providers_happy_talk}} would be happy to {{talk_over_offer_additional}} this over with you and {{offer_additional_interventions_schedule}}. Please schedule a {{telemedicine_consultation_want_support}} if you want {{more_support_address_primary_care}}.

## **{{coags_section}}** **Risk for Blood Clots and Cerebral Vascular Disease**

{{coags_checked_d_dimer}} We checked a {{d_dimer_level_elevated}} level which was {{elevated_d_dimer_value}} mg/L. The {{d_dimer_top_mind_awareness}} has more {{top_mind_awareness_covid_pandemic}} since the {{covid_pandemic_risk_neurodegenerative}} If you are at {{risk_neurodegenerative_disorder_vascular}} from {{vascular_risk_factors_heart_disease}} ({{heart_disease_stroke_blood_clot}} or {{blood_clot_not_currently_taking}} and you are {{not_currently_taking_anticoagulant}} like {{anticoagulant_eliquis_xarelto}} (and {{many_others_consider_starting}} you may {{consider_starting_otc_supplements}} a few {{otc_supplements_lower_risk}}.

{{coags_encouraged_start_nitric_balance}}
You are encouraged to {{start_supplement_nitric_balance}}. The standard dose is {{1_2_tsp_2xs_day}} This supplement is a {{rapid_acting_liposomal_preparation}} that contains {{vinpocetine_nutraceuticals_support}} and other {{nutraceuticals_support_dilation}} that support {{dilation_blood_vessels_improved}}.

{{coags_encouraged_start_neurox}}
You are encouraged to {{start_supplement_neurox_standard_dose}} The standard dose is {{1_capsule_2xs_day_neurox}} This supplement is a {{capsule_contains_vinpocetine_nutraceuticals}} that contains {{vinpocetine_nutraceuticals_support_vasodilation}}.

{{coags_historical_blood_clot_consideration}}
If you have had a {{historical_blood_clot_high_risk}} or you are at {{high_risk_vascular_issues}} you may consider {{checking_factor_v_leiden_genetics}}.

Your {{platelet_count_suboptimal_obvious}} is suboptimal but there is {{no_obvious_contributor_history}} If you are taking any {{medications_nsaids_acid_reducers}} ({{nsaids_acid_reducers_seizure_medications}} etc.), these can {{contribute_low_trending_platelet}}. Consider the {{cyrex_array_5_panel}} to {{rule_predictive_autoimmunity_neural_tissues}}.

Your {{white_blood_cell_wbc_status}} count {{wbc_status}} was {{quick_wbc_value}}, your {{absolute_neutrophil_count_status}} was {{quick_anc_value}}, and your {{absolute_lymphocyte_count_status}} was {{quick_alc_value}}. These cell counts represent a {{generalized_reflection_immune_response}}.

These markers fall within the {{optimal_parameters_intervention_recommended_immune}}.

{{quick_immune_elevated_consideration}}
At least one of {{these_values_elevated_reflect}} is {{elevated_reflect_active_immune}} and may reflect an {{active_immune_response_encourage}} We encourage you to {{consult_primary_care_provider_values}}.

{{quick_immune_suppressed_consideration}}
At least one of {{these_values_lower_expected}} is {{lower_expected_suspicious_weakened}} than expected and may be {{suspicious_weakened_immune_response}} for a {{weakened_immune_response_one_time}} This may be a {{one_time_result_current_pattern}} in your current, or it {{may_pattern_shows_persistently}}.
