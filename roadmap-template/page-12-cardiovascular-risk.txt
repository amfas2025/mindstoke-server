There is so much more that could be said about optimizing your diet, but recommendations should be {{personalized_prioritized_diet}}. Additional information about optimizing your diet and meal plans can be found on our community website at {{community_website_link}}.

Some members may benefit from a 'deeper dive' into the following areas:

➤ **{{ketogenic_diets_focus}}** that focus on lowering {{blood_sugar_metabolic_disorders}} and metabolic disorders for individuals with {{dementia_persistent_mental_health}} or persistent mental health challenges. For those who choose to embrace {{ketogenic_dieting}}, you are encouraged to purchase a {{ketone_monitor_strips}} or {{ketone_urine_strips}} to validate that you are in {{metabolic_ketosis_verification}} as you work through the diet.

➤ **{{autoimmune_paleo_diets}}** and the {{carnivore_diet_approach}} can help members that struggle with {{autoimmune_diseases_chronic_allergies}}. One of the goals of these {{dietary_approaches_avoid_inflammatory}} is to avoid {{inflammatory_proteins_immune_activation}} that activate the immune system.

➤ A **{{low_carb_diet_approach}}** is a less restrictive diet that aims to lower {{simple_carbohydrates_diet}} in the diet to better {{control_blood_sugar_metabolic_health}}.

➤ The **{{mind_diet_dash_diet}}** are approaches that have been shown to lower {{salt_congestion_heart_failure}} for those with {{congestive_heart_failure_blood_pressure}}.

➤ The **{{mediterranean_diet_benefits}}** is good for {{metabolic_health_cardiovascular_disease}}, {{high_cholesterol_challenges}}, and a host of other challenges.

It is difficult to cover all your questions about the best diet for you, but we are happy to answer questions during {{office_hours_diet_questions}} and respond to your inquiries through our {{community_membership_support}}. If you need a {{tlc_personalized_approach}} to help you with diet and menu planning, please consider scheduling a {{coaching_call_telemedicine}} with one of our medical providers. {{additional_fees_apply_consultation}}.

**Cardiovascular Risk and Cholesterol Levels**

Your **{{total_cholesterol_level_status}}** level was {{total_cholesterol_actual_value}}. While cardiologists like to see {{total_cholesterol_targets}} levels < {{cholesterol_target_200}}, we are a little more liberal with this marker.

Your **{{triglyceride_level_status}}** level was {{triglyceride_actual_value}}. The optimal level is thought to be <{{triglyceride_target_150}}, especially if you have {{insulin_resistance_diabetes_elevated_triglycerides}}. This cholesterol marker is highly influenced by your {{carbohydrate_sugar_intake}}. If you want to lower your {{triglyceride_optimization}}, stop eating sugar!

Your **{{hdl_cholesterol_status}}**, which is often considered 'the good cholesterol,' was {{hdl_actual_value}}. The optimal is >{{hdl_target_40}} and the more significant way to raise this level is {{exercise_optimization}}.

Your **{{ldl_cholesterol_status}}**, which is often considered 'the bad cholesterol' was {{ldl_actual_value}}. Cardiologists often use your {{ldl_cholesterol_assessment}} to predict your risk for {{cardiovascular_lowering_medication}} like {{statin_therapy_risks}}. We are more cautious with {{statin_medications_risks}} due to their risk of causing {{brain_fog_insulin_resistance_coq10}}.

Your **{{trig_hdl_ratio_status}}** was {{trig_hdl_actual_ratio}}. The optimal RATIO is <{{trig_hdl_target_2}}. Anything above {{trig_hdl_insulin_resistance_threshold}} is a sign of {{insulin_resistance_marker}}.

{{cardiovascular_risk_factors_summary}}
Too often, we pin our views of {{good_vascular_health}} on {{low_cholesterol_levels}}. However, there are a few other {{risk_factors_contribute_cardiovascular}} that contribute to {{good_cardiovascular_brain_health}}. We have summarized these {{risk_factors_masterclass}} in a masterclass.
