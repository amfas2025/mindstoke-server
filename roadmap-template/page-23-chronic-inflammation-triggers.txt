# Chronic Inflammation Can Lead to Inflammation in Your Brain

Many individuals do not realize that there is a {{relationship_inflammation_body_brain}} between inflammation in the {{body_brain_health_constant_inflammation}}. If you are in a {{constant_state_inflammation_brain}} of inflammation, the {{brain_negatively_impacted_lab_tests}} will be negatively impacted. If one of the {{lab_tests_shown_exceeds_threshold}} below exceeds the {{threshold_optimal_health_brain}} for optimal health ({{brain_health_treatment_intervention}} health), {{treatment_intervention_recommended}} may be recommended. You are encouraged to {{take_considerations_back_primary}} these considerations back to your {{primary_care_provider_schedule}} or schedule a {{telemedicine_consultation_provider_form}} with a provider. {{form_mind_for_seasons}}.

Your baseline {{hscrp_status}} is {{quick_hscrp_lab_value}}. The goal is to have a {{very_low_level_1_mg}} very low level, at {{least_1_mg_hscrp}}. {{hscrp_general_marker_systemic}} is a general marker of {{systemic_inflammation_chronic_brain}}. Please review the {{potential_causes_elevated_hscrp}} of an {{elevated_hscrp_work_resolve}} and work to {{resolve_triggers_systemic_inflammation}}.

There are many {{potential_causes_form_low_grade}} for {{low_grade_systemic_inflammation_chart}} systemic inflammation. The {{chart_below_help_identify}} below will help you {{identify_potential_contributors_insight}} and you may also {{find_insight_triggers_inflammation}} by reviewing our {{membership_site_triggers_systemic_inflammation}}.

{{crp_1_conclusion}}
Some of our {{clients_interested_brain_specific}} are interested in '{{brain_specific_markers_inflammation}}' markers of inflammation that {{can_predictive_alzheimers}} can be more predictive of {{alzheimers_neurodegenerative_diseases}}. You may choose to {{complete_test_apo_e4}} this test if you have the {{apo_e4_genetics_strong_family}} genetics or a {{strong_family_history_alzheimers}}. This {{inflammatory_panel_neurocode_test}}.
