Your Baseline Cognitive Test Results

Each participant in The Enhance Protocol™ completes at least one baseline cognitive test. Depending on your age and your current cognitive health, you have been asked to complete a {{cognitive_test_type}} test or a computer-based {{cognitive_test_alternative}} test. Your test results will summarize below, and we will use a copy of your complete results. Please email info@amindforallseasons.com and we will send you the full report.

The Enhance Protocol® is designed to help improve brain functioning from your baseline. We look forward to helping you complete a retest once you have applied the recommendations in your Roadmap Report for a few months. Please attend one of our online {{office_hours_link}} sessions and ask for guidance regarding how to understand your specific test results.
