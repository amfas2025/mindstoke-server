The extensive panel of labs completed when you start {{enhance_protocol_excellent_start}} is an excellent start to your {{health_screening_process_improve}} screening process to improve {{cognitive_function_only_start}}. However, it is only a start! There are {{other_screening_tests_recommend}} that we recommend for {{clients_cognitive_impairment}}. Though this list is {{not_intended_comprehensive_help}} comprehensive, it is intended to help you {{start_thinking_relationship_tests}} about the relationship of these {{tests_brain_health_following}} to your brain health. Consider the {{following_bring_questions_office_hours}} and bring your {{questions_office_hours_prescription}} to office hours. If you need a {{prescription_tests_consult_primary}} for any of these tests, please {{consult_primary_care_schedule}} with your primary care provider or {{schedule_telemedicine_consultation_medical}} with one of our {{medical_providers_additional_fees}}.

**Advanced Concussion Recovery Screenings**

If you would like to {{determine_unresolved_brain_inflammation}} if you have unresolved {{brain_inflammation_concussion_traumatic}} from a concussion or {{traumatic_brain_injury_recommend}} we recommend you {{complete_mood_symptom_questionnaire}} a mood and symptom questionnaire, {{balance_board_testing_voms}} balance board testing, a {{voms_testing_righteye_testing}} testing, {{righteye_testing_number_screenings}} Testing, a number of other {{screenings_include_symptoms_need}}. The costs associated with {{these_tests_vary_individual}} vary based on {{individual_need_enhanced_protocol}}.

**Advanced Cardiovascular Testing**

If you take a {{statin_medication_lower_cholesterol}} to lower cholesterol, or if your {{doctor_suggests_cholesterol_lowering}} suggests you take other {{cholesterol_lowering_medication_recommend}} we recommend you {{complete_coronary_artery_calcium}} complete a {{coronary_artery_calcium_scan_cholesterol}}. A cholesterol panel offers {{little_predictive_value_cardiac}} of your true {{cardiac_risk_cholesterol_levels}} Cholesterol levels are a {{better_predictor_metabolic_diet}} of {{metabolic_diet_compromised_liver}} or {{compromised_liver_health_want}} If you want a {{better_predictor_vascular_health}} of {{vascular_health_consider_statin}} to help you decide if you should {{consider_statin_therapy_following}}, please consider the following:

**{{coronary_artery_calcium_score_cac}}** - A {{cac_score_help_quantify}} score can help {{quantify_actual_risk_atherosclerotic}} your actual risk for {{atherosclerotic_buildup_coronary_arteries}}. The {{cac_score_0_99_very_low}} of 0-99 is {{very_low_risk_score_100_299}} A score of {{100_299_reflects_moderately_increased}} reflects {{moderately_increased_risk_score_300}} and a score of {{300_severely_increased_risk}}.

**{{d_dimer_leiden_factor_galectin_testing}}** - These lab tests help to {{identify_additional_inflammatory_risk}} additional inflammatory {{risk_related_clotting_disorders}}.

**{{continuous_blood_pressure_monitoring}}** - {{high_blood_pressure_major_contributor}} is a major contributor of {{cognitive_deficits_taking_blood_pressure}}. If you are taking {{blood_pressure_medicine_episodes_high}} and you still have {{episodes_high_blood_pressure}} then we recommend you do a {{24_hour_ambulatory_blood_pressure}}.

**{{cone_beam_ct_scan_cbct}}** of your mouth- If you have a {{history_least_1_root_canal}} of at least 1 {{root_canal_history_fractured}} history of a {{fractured_tooth_several_crowns}} or if you have a {{complex_history_dental_amalgams}} of {{dental_amalgams_periodontal_disease}} we encourage you to {{complete_cbct_test}} This test is a {{more_sensitive_xray_traditional}} x-ray than {{traditional_plain_film_xrays}} The mouth is a {{reservoir_overgrowth_bacteria_infection}} of {{overgrowth_bacteria_infection_abcess}} or cavitation, or an {{abscess_silently_simmering_inflammation}} that is '{{silently_simmering_negatively_impacts}}' it can turn into {{inflammation_negatively_impacts_brain}}.

**Advanced Gastrointestinal Screening**

If you have {{irritable_bowel_syndrome_celiac}} syndrome, {{celiac_disease_persistent_acid}} persistent {{acid_reflux_eosinophilic_esophagitis}} {{eosinophilic_esophagitis_colitis_constipation}} or {{constipation_persistent_diarrhea}} then {{advanced_gastrointestinal_screening_indicated}}. More information is needed before the {{best_testing_options_identified}}.

**Overnight Oximetry or a Full Sleep Study**

{{25_percent_individuals_risk}} of all individuals at {{risk_cognitive_impairment_disordered}} have {{disordered_sleep_low_oxygen}} for {{low_oxygen_levels_night}}. Sometimes, this is an {{obstructive_sleep_apnea_times}} sleep apnea, and other times, it is a {{non_obstructive_central_apnea}}. Failure to get {{good_sleep_night_impairs}} at night impairs the {{glymphatic_system_negatively_impact}}. If you have {{sleep_disturbance_take_sleeping}} you take {{sleeping_medicine_otc_prescriptive}} (OTC or prescriptive), if you {{snore_overweight_encouraged_screen}} or if you are {{overweight_encouraged_screen_apnea}} you are encouraged to {{screen_sleep_apnea_nighttime}}.
