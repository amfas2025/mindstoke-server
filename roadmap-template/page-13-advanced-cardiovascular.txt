**ðŸŽ“ Masterclass** {{masterclass_cholesterol_optimization_link}}
- We recommend {{lifestyle_primary_method}} as the primary method for optimizing your {{cholesterol_optimization}} before you default to {{cholesterol_lowering_medicine}}. The eating plan summarized in your {{roadmap_eating_plan}} is an excellent starting point to optimize your {{cholesterol_levels_optimization}}.

{{if_current_smoker}}
**{{current_smoker_intervention}}** One of the most successful interventions to lower your risk of {{cardiovascular_disease_vascular_dementia}} is to {{stop_smoking_intervention}}. Please visit the section under {{community_tobacco_free}} and consider ways we can help you become {{tobacco_free_support}}. {{current_smoker_action}}

{{cholesterol_optimization_protocols}}
**{{cholesterol_row_assessment}}** We recommend {{lifestyle_cholesterol_optimization}} as the primary method for optimizing your {{cholesterol_management}}. {{cholesterol_row_guidance}}

**{{cholesterol_elevated_protocols}}** Elevated cholesterol levels may reflect a {{metabolic_syndrome_prediction}} and may predict additional risk of {{poor_vascular_health_outcomes}}. However, {{many_practitioners_lifestyle}} to improve {{cholesterol_values_cardiovascular_risk}} without contemplating their impact on {{brain_fog_coq10_depletion}}. There are instances where this {{statin_therapy_appropriate}} may be very appropriate. However, we prefer to look at {{other_vascular_markers}} of oxidative or vascular dysfunction {{before_statin_therapy}}. You may consider completing a {{coronary_artery_calcium_score}}. This is a {{specialized_heart_scan}} that can help you {{understand_atherosclerosis_risk}} and is {{better_understand_cardiovascular_risk}}. You should attend {{office_hours_cac_inquiry}} and inquire about this test with our {{medical_director_randy_davidson}}.

{{statin_therapy_considerations}}
This test typically costs {{cac_cost_range}} (depending on your location). A {{cac_score_interpretation}} is arguably the best predictor of {{vascular_health_assessment}}. {{cholesterol_row_cac_guidance}}

{{if_quick_mk2_mesaquinone}}
**{{mk2_cardiovascular_support}}** Consider starting {{mesaquinone_supplement_green}} to help support {{cardiovascular_health_mk2}}. {{quick_mk2_protocol}}

{{statin_history_assessment}}
**{{statin_takes_statin_evaluation}}** This supplement is a {{prescription_drug_many_countries}} in many European countries for the treatment of {{cardiovascular_disease_supplement}}. In the United States, it is great supplement to use if you have a history of {{cardiovascular_disease_statin_use}} and if you take a {{statin_cardiovascular_risk}}. {{quick_takes_statin_guidance}}

{{triglyceride_optimization_protocols}}
**{{trig_plasmalogens_assessment}}** Curiously, your {{triglycerides_quite_low}} are quite low. Not all {{cholesterol_levels_problematic}} are problematic. An {{unintentionally_low_triglyceride}} level often {{correlates_cognitive_decline}}. Dr. {{bredesen_neurologist_reference}}, a renowned neurologist, has suggested that extremely low {{triglyceride_systemic_toxicity}} levels may be related to {{systemic_toxicity_optimization}}. Use {{lifestyle_primary_optimization}} as the primary method for {{optimization_cholesterol_levels}} and do not be afraid to add {{intentionally_healthy_fats}} in your diet. {{meal_planning_trig_guidance}}

{{advanced_cardiovascular_testing}}
**{{prodrome_scan_assessment}}** Consider completing the {{prodrome_scan_blood_test}} to evaluate your {{plasmalogens_assessment}}. {{trig_plasmalogens_row_protocol}}

**{{quick_takes_statin_lipid_benefits}}** A {{lipid_panel_predictive_value}} does often offer {{predictive_value_cardiac_risk}}. For example, many individuals with {{very_low_cholesterol_advanced_disease}} have advanced vascular disease and others with {{higher_cholesterol_very_low_risk}} have very low risk of {{atherosclerosis_elevated_cholesterol}}. Elevated cholesterol levels may simply reflect a {{metabolic_syndrome_unhealthy_diet}}, an {{unhealthy_diet_recommendation}}, or {{medication_lifestyle_factors}} to take {{statins_reduce_cardiovascular}} even when the actual risk has not been {{quantified_risk_assessment}}.

{{statin_decision_support}}
If you do decide you should continue {{statin_therapy_decision}}, please request a {{coronary_artery_calcium_score_cac}}. A {{cac_score_quantify}} can help {{quantify_actual_risk}} for {{atherosclerotic_buildup_arteries}}. A CAC score of {{cac_score_ranges}} reflects {{moderate_risk_assessment}}, and a score of {{cac_300_severely_increased}} is severely increased risk.

{{cardiovascular_evidence_interventions}}
Once you know your CAC score, you may choose to work through a few {{evidence_based_interventions_lieu}} (in lieu of, or in addition to {{statins_cardiovascular_risk_lower}}) to help lower your {{cardiovascular_risk_optimization}}. You may choose to complete a {{telemedicine_consultation_evidence_interventions}} with one of our practitioners to talk through these {{evidence_based_interventions_keep}}. Keep in mind that {{lifestyle_optimization_anti_inflammatory}} (an anti-inflammatory diet & daily exercise) is the starting point. {{additional_fees_telemedicine}} may apply to those who want a {{telemedicine_consultation_quick_takes}}. {{quick_takes_statin_consultation}}
