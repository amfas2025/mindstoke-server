level was {{reverse_t3_free_t3_value}} pg/mL. The optimal range is > {{reverse_t3_optimal_range}} pg/mL. Your {{reverse_t3_level_elevated}} level is elevated at {{reverse_t3_actual_elevated_value}}. {{reverse_t3_thyroid_function_optimization}} These values fall outside of the {{optimal_parameters_thyroid_function}}, and you may be a candidate for a trial of a {{prescription_medicine_thyroid_optimization}}. {{prescription_medicine_telemedicine_consultation}}

**{{quick_reverse_t3_elevated_consideration}}** An elevated {{reverse_t3_may_suggest}} level may be suggestive of a {{process_impairs_functional_thyroid}} that impairs {{functional_thyroid_free_t3}}. REVERSE T3 is a {{functionally_aerodynamic_t3}} version of T3. This has the potential of {{blocking_free_t3_receptors}} and {{diminishing_effectiveness_free_t3}}. Though the precise reason your body makes {{reverse_t3_unknown}} is unknown, it can be related to {{low_levels_vitamin_b12}} {{ferritin_elevated_cortisol_levels}}. You may consider asking for a {{cortisol_blood_draw_fasting_reverse_t3}}

**{{quick_hashimotos_autoimmune_consideration}}** You may have some symptoms of {{autoimmune_thyroiditis_additional}} and {{additional_autoimmunity_testing}} may be helpful. For those with laboratory markers of {{autoimmune_thyroiditis_naltrexone_research}}, you may choose to {{research_compounded_medication_ldn}} called {{low_dose_naltrexone_ldn}}. Information about {{ldn_provided_guidebook}} is provided in your {{guidebook_ldn_information}}. Your {{ldn_attention_providers_amfas}} will need to provide detailed information if you {{think_intervention_ldn}} this may be an intervention for you to implement. {{additional_family_physician_inflammation}} with {{ldn_autoimmune_disease}} you should consider an {{ldn_supplement_advanced_amfas}} or {{telemedicine_consultation_providers}} consultation with a {{provider_amfas_fees}}. {{additional_fees_may_apply_ldn}}

**{{female_hormones_baseline_fsh}}** Your baseline {{fsh_level_status}} level was {{lab_fsh_result_value}} mIU/mL. Optimal ranges of {{fsh_dependent_age}} are dependent on {{age_menstrual_menopausal_status}} and {{brain_health_menstrual_status}}. If you are not {{menopausal_fsh_tends_11}}, the {{fsh_level_closer_20}} level tends to be < 11.
