{{genome-type}} Your APO E Genotype is {{genome-type}}. Your GLUTATHIONE level was {{GLUT_VALUE}} Î¼g/mL.

{{#quick-E4}}
You have the APO E E4 / E4 genetic variant, which DOES increase your risk for Alzheimer's Dementia, cardiovascular disease, and potentially other neurodegenerative diseases. This finding is significant.
{{/quick-E4}}

{{#quick-E4E3}}
You have the APO E E4 / E3 genetic variant, which DOES increase your risk for Alzheimer's Dementia, cardiovascular disease, and potentially other neurodegenerative diseases. This finding is significant.
{{/quick-E4E3}}
