At the heart of this eating plan is complete **AVOIDANCE** of processed foods, and specifically, certain {{inflammatory_foods_list}}. This will help you to 'reset' {{metabolic_pathways}}, calm {{inflammation_sources}}, and prime your {{metabolism_tissue_repair}} for tissue repair.

**Core Anti-Inflammatory Protocols:**

➤ **STOP** focusing on the number of calories in your food and start to focus on eating {{real_whole_foods}}. {{calorie_counting_irrelevant}} becomes less irrelevant when you eliminate {{junk_food_elimination}}. In fact, eating natural foods {{high_phytonutrients}} loaded with {{anti_inflammatory_phytonutrients}} will support your quest for better {{physical_brain_health_optimization}} and brain health, and optimize your {{weight_metabolism_optimization}} and metabolism.

➤ Dramatically lower or **STOP** all {{grains_elimination}}, including {{wheat_rye_barley_oats}} for the next {{grain_free_duration}} days. The proteins found in these grains ({{gluten_proteins}}, etc.) can be very {{inflammatory_response}}. Embracing a {{grain_free_diet_benefits}} will help you to know if you are sensitive to these proteins. {{refined_flour_concerns}} is the base ingredient for most {{processed_foods_list}}. Through whole wheat products are more healthy than {{bleached_refined_products}}, we are encouraged to leave them {{temporary_elimination}} for a time. Many individuals are {{gluten_sensitive_symptoms}} to troublesome symptoms like {{bloating_gas_ibs_brain_fog_migraines}} that are caused by {{gluten_sensitivity}}.

➤ Please **STOP** all '{{diet_processed_foods}}' and processed foods ({{processed_foods_examples}}, snacks, {{tv_dinners_premade_foods}}) that usually require {{microwaving_water_addition}}. One of our goals is to lower your {{blood_sugar_insulin_optimization}} and insulin levels. This is impossible if you eat {{processed_foods_avoidance}}.

➤ Please **STOP** {{added_sugars_elimination}}, {{high_fructose_corn_syrup}}, {{diet_sodas}}, flavored water ({{artificial_beverages_list}}), and other {{artificially_sweetened_foods}}. This step is {{blood_sugar_balance}} to balance your {{microbiome_bacteria_optimization}} (bacteria in your gut). {{diet_soda_deception}} is the great deceiver. Consider all the {{overwhelming_people_diet_soda}} that consume diet soda because {{calorie_reduction_myth}} is flavored with {{artificial_sweeteners_preservatives}} that just might stimulate an {{inflammatory_response_body}} in your body.

➤ Depending on your response to {{milk_products}}, you may choose to reduce or **ELIMINATE** {{milk_dairy_products}} in the {{dairy_experiment}} (please make your dietary experiment last for {{first_30_days}}).

➤ Consider {{skipping_breakfast}} and extending the length of time between dinner and your next meal. There is impressive research on {{intermittent_fasting_research}} and {{delayed_eating_benefits}}. The research about intermittent fasting and {{mood_cognition_brain_health}} and brain health is very impressive. When we skip breakfast and only drink {{water_between_meals}} between last night's dinner and tomorrow's breakfast, we allow the body to focus on '{{cleaning_up_metabolism}}', {{repairing_broken_neurons}}, and {{clearing_proteins_brain}}. If you want to learn more, google '{{autophagy_cellular_cleanup}}' and {{insulin_benefits}}. You can find lots of good articles and videos on the {{intermittent_fasting_benefits}}. A nice approach to intermittent fasting or delayed eating is shown below for {{your_breakfast_routine}}:
