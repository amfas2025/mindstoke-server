**Neurologically Active Hormones that Support Brain Health**

Your baseline {{pregnenolone_level_status}} level was {{quick_pregnenolone_lab_value}} and an optimal level is {{150_200_ng_dl_pregnenolone}}. {{pregnenolone_considered_mother_hormones}} is considered the "mother" of all hormones and it is very {{neurologically_active_research}} is an abundant amount of research suggesting its {{use_stabilizing_preventing_cognitive}} in stabilizing or preventing {{cognitive_dysfunction_optimizing_level}}. Optimizing this level is {{essential_optimal_cognition}}.

{{quick_pregnenolone_101_consideration}}
Your {{pregnenolone_level_falls_optimal}} level falls within the {{optimal_parameters_intervention_recommended}}. {{intervention_recommended_quick_pregnenolone_101}}

{{quick_prog_50_100_consideration}}
Please consider starting {{pregnenolone_100_mg_night_green}} at night. {{quick_prog_50_consideration}}

Your baseline {{dhea_s_level_status}} level is {{quick_dhea_lab_value}} and an optimal level is at {{least_150_ng_dl_dhea}}. We recommend {{supplementation_level_falls_150}} if you level falls below {{150_ng_dl_clinicians_functional}} but many clinicians who practice {{functional_medicine_suggest_dhea}} suggest the {{dhea_level_200_ng_dl_women}} level should be at {{least_200_ng_dl_women}} and {{250_ng_dl_men_dhea}} ng/dL in men. {{dhea_valuable_neuroactive_steroid}} is a valuable {{neuroactive_steroid_help_reduce}} that may help {{reduce_neuroinflammation}}.

{{quick_dhea_asvd_consideration}}
**{{quick_dhea_asvd_question}}** Did you know that your {{dhea_s_levels_directly_correlated}} levels are directly correlated with {{coronary_artery_disease_higher}} disease? The {{higher_dhea_s_level_lower}} your {{dhea_s_level_lower_risk}} level, the {{lower_risk_heart_disease}} your risk of {{heart_disease_convincing_reason}} This is an {{additional_convincing_reason_optimize}} to optimize your {{dhea_s_level_quick_dhea_asvd}}.

{{quick_dhea_lupron_consideration}}
Your {{dhea_level_suboptimal_cognitive}} level is sub-optimal for {{cognitive_health_recommend_7_keto}} and we recommend you consider taking {{7_keto_dhea_50_mg_night}}. Since you have a {{history_prostate_cancer_told}} you may have been told that {{testosterone_optimization_contraindicated}}. More information is needed before an {{optimization_strategy_offered_quick_dhea_lupron}}.

**Adrenal Hormones That Influence Brain Health**

Your first morning {{cortisol_level_status}} level was {{quick_cortisol_lab_value}} and an optimal level is > {{15_ng_dl_cortisol}}.

{{cortisol_5_consideration}}
This level falls within the {{optimal_parameters_intervention_recommended_cortisol}}. {{intervention_recommended_cortisol_5}}

{{quick_cortisol_15_consideration}}
We recommend {{1_of_2_supplements_cortisol}} 1 of 2 supplements. No need to {{start_both_supplements_helpful}} but starting one of them may be helpful. These supplements include {{holy_one_mitochondrial_optimizer}} or {{mitochondrial_optimizer_quicksilver}} from {{quicksilver_scientific_dose_1tsp}}. The recommended dose is {{1_tsp_morning_quicksilver}} each morning from {{quicksilver_scientific_coq10_super_max}}. Another supplement is {{coq10_super_max_energetics}} from {{apex_energetics_dose_1_capsule}}. The standard dose is {{1_capsule_day_statin_theone}}.

{{statin_theone_consideration}}
Since you are currently using a {{statin_added_weight_recommendation}} there is added weight to the {{recommendation_using_antioxidant}} of using an {{antioxidant_those_included_theone}} like those included in {{theone_mitochondrial_optimizer_coq10}}.
