**{{homocysteine_interpretation}} Homocysteine Levels Can Impair Brain Function**

Your {{homocysteine_level_status}} level was {{homocysteine_actual_value}}. Since {{homocysteine_brain_correlation}} is linked to inflammation, we recommend a goal level < {{homocysteine_target_level}} umol/L. An elevated {{homocysteine_risk_explanation}} level correlates with both {{heart_disease_risk}} and {{cognitive_disorders_risk}}. By improving your {{homocysteine_improvement_strategy}} levels, you effectively lower your risk of both disease states.

Your {{vitamin_b12_level_interpretation}} level was {{vitamin_b12_actual_value}}. The goal is > {{vitamin_b12_target_level}} pg/mL to best support brain health.

Your {{folate_level_interpretation}} level (often called {{folic_acid_explanation}}) is {{folate_actual_value}}. The goal is > {{folate_target_level}} ng/mL to best support brain health.
