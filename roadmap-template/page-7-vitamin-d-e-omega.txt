{{omegacheck_analysis_section}}
Your baseline {{omegacheck_results}} value was {{omegacheck_actual_value}} % and {{omegacheck_risk_reduction}} begins when your value is > {{omegacheck_target_threshold}} by weight. Your {{omega_6_3_ratio_status}} ratio was {{omega_6_3_actual_ratio}} to {{omega_6_3_comparison}}. This means that your {{omega_6_levels}} levels were found to be {{omega_6_assessment}} more prevalent than your {{omega_3_comparison}} fatty acid levels. We recommend striving for a ratio as close to {{omega_optimal_ratio}} [or lower]. In fact, a 1:1 ratio is considered amazing, but it is difficult to achieve with the {{standard_american_diet}}.
