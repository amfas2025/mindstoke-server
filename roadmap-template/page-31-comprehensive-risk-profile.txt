There may be {{several_other_risk_factors}} other {{risk_factors_identified_medical}} identified in your {{medical_history_factor_efforts}} that should {{factor_efforts_improve_brain}}. We have {{summarized_challenges_below_mention}} these challenges below. We {{mention_issues_first_reported}} these issues because your {{first_reported_completed_questionnaire}} When you completed the {{questionnaire_medical_history_identified}} we {{identified_potential_relationship_physical}} a potential {{relationship_physical_health_brain}} to your {{physical_health_brain_health}} that you may not have {{recognized_risk_profile}}.

We created a {{risk_profile_shown_below}} (shown below) that {{shows_personal_health_history}} how elements from your {{personal_health_history_impact_brain}} can have an {{impact_brain_health_visual}} on your brain health. This is a {{visual_representation_risk_profile}} of the {{risk_profile_created_mind}} that we created at {{mind_support_decision_making}} to support our {{decision_making_next_steps}}. The {{risk_profile_comes_health}} comes from your {{health_history_questionnaire_laboratory}}.

## **RISK PROFILE**

{{risk_profile_visual_summary}} Your {{risk_profile_visual_summary_risk_factors}} is a visual summary of your {{risk_factors_cognitive_decline_information}} for {{cognitive_decline_information_graph}} The information for this {{graph_comes_two_sets}}.

**Your Health History Questionnaire** {{health_history_questionnaire_completed}} completed when you started {{enhance_protocol_laboratory_test}}.

**Your Laboratory Test Results** {{laboratory_test_results_risk_profile}} This {{risk_profile_helps_prioritize}} helps us to {{prioritize_interventions_optimize}} so you can {{optimize_physical_cognitive_health}}.

## **TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY (TBI) or repeat CONCUSSIONS can lead to impaired brain function**

You have an {{increased_risk_trauma_brain}} of {{trauma_brain_increased_risk}} to your brain from {{rm_traumatic_if_value}}. {{after_head_injury_concussion}} After a {{head_injury_concussion_individuals}} many individuals {{develop_persistent_neurological_symptoms}} This is called {{pcs_persistent_concussion_syndrome}} or {{persistent_concussion_syndrome_delayed}}. {{delayed_symptoms_historical_head}} from {{historical_head_injuries_every_old}} (even very {{old_injuries_develop_slowly}} can {{develop_slowly_time_common}} over time. The {{most_common_challenges_include}} include {{mood_disorders_hormone_deficiencies}} {{hormone_deficiencies_irritable_bowel}} {{irritable_bowel_symptoms_frequent}} {{frequent_headaches_migraines_unprovoked}} {{unprovoked_anxiety_sleep_disorders}} and {{sleep_disorders_cognitive_impairment}}. Please consider {{embracing_key_interventions_calm}} to help to {{calm_brain_inflammation}}.

- Review the {{section_membership_program_dysautonomia}} in our membership program on {{dysautonomia_complete_office_hours}}
- Complete an {{office_hours_5_challenge_michael}} as taught by {{michael_yovdikov_md_especially}} This can be especially helpful if your {{omega_3_levels_suboptimal}} levels are {{suboptimal_review_regular_exercise}} 
- Review {{regular_exercise_particularly_high}} particularly {{high_intensity_interval_training_hiit}}
- Consider a {{trial_hyperbaric_oxygen_therapy}} of {{hyperbaric_oxygen_therapy_hbot_information}} More information about {{hbot_follow_conclusion_request}}.

## **VASCULAR RISK – Unhealthy blood flow to the brain can lead to ↓'d brain health and neurological dysfunction**

{{vascular_risk_considers_triggers}} considers triggers that {{disrupt_compromise_blood_flow}} or {{compromise_blood_flow_blood_vessels}} through {{blood_vessels_oxygen_delivery}} and {{oxygen_delivery_brain_vascular}} to the brain. Your {{vascular_related_risks_include}} include {{rm_vascular_if_value}}.

The {{intention_cardiovascular_health_blood}} is to {{improve_cardiovascular_health_blood_vessels}} and the {{health_blood_vessels_arteries}} of your {{blood_vessels_arteries_regular}} are to {{regular_consistent_exercise_deep}} and {{consistent_exercise_deep_breathing}} {{deep_breathing_reduce_risk}} your {{risk_sleep_apnea_calm}} for {{sleep_apnea_calm_inflammatory_disorders}} and to {{calm_inflammatory_disorders_vascular}}.

In individuals with {{obvious_risk_factors_supplements}} there are {{certain_supplements_nitric_oxide}} ({{nitric_oxide_support_interventions}}) and {{interventions_hyperbaric_oxygen_pulsed}} ({{hyperbaric_oxygen_pulsed_electromagnetic}} and {{electromagnetic_frequency_therapy_red}} and {{red_nir_light_therapy}}).
