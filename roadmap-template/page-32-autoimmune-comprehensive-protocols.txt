## **INSUFFICIENCY SYNDROMES such as suboptimal levels of nutrients, minerals, and hormones can impact brain health**

When the body has {{insufficient_levels_nutrients}} levels of {{nutrients_hormones_functions}} or hormones, the {{functions_central_nervous_system}} of the {{central_nervous_system_cns}} (CNS) is {{negatively_impacted_lead_atrophic}} and can lead to {{atrophic_symptoms_brain_nerves}} in the {{brain_nerves_common_form}} The most {{common_form_insufficiency_syndrome}} of {{insufficiency_syndrome_women_menopause}} in women is {{menopause_potential_risk_factors}} Your {{potential_risk_factors_include_rm}} include {{rm_atrophic_if_value}}.
