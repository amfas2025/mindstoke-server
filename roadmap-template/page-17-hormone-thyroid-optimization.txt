**Hormone Optimization Can Improve Your Brain Function**

Many individuals do not realize that there is an {{optimal_hormone_level_brain}} for {{brain_health_hormone_optimization}}. When {{hormone_levels_drop_brain_function}} drop, {{brain_function_diminished}}. This section focuses on the importance of your {{hormone_levels_potential_impact}} and their {{potential_impact_brain_health}}.

**Thyroid Function and Brain Health**

Your baseline {{tsh_level_status}} was {{tsh_actual_value}}. The goal level for {{optimizing_cognition_tsh}} is {{tsh_target_range}} uIU/mL.

Your baseline {{free_t3_status}} was {{free_t3_actual_value}}. The goal level for {{optimizing_cognition_ft3}} is {{free_t3_target_range}} uIU/mL.

Your baseline {{free_t4_status}} was {{free_t4_actual_value}}. The goal level for {{optimizing_cognition_ft4}} is {{free_t4_target_range}} uIU/mL.

{{thyroid_comprehensive_assessment}}
**{{thyroid_row_assessment}}** Your baseline {{reverse_t3_status}} was {{reverse_t3_actual_value}}. The goal level for {{optimizing_cognition_rt3}} is < {{reverse_t3_target_15}} uIU/mL.

**{{thyroid_peroxidase_antibody_assessment}}** Your baseline {{thyroid_peroxidase_antibody_status}} level was {{tpo_antibody_actual_value}}. When {{tpo_antibody_elevation}} is > {{tpo_antibody_threshold}}, we begin to consider your risk for an {{autoimmune_disorder_hashimotos}}.

**{{thyroglobulin_antibody_assessment}}** Your {{thyroglobulin_antibody_status}} level was {{thyroglobulin_antibody_actual_value}}. When {{tgab_levels_elevation}} are > {{tgab_threshold}}, this is an additional sign that you have risk for a variant of {{hashimotos_thyroiditis_variant}}. When either of the {{thyroid_antibody_flagged}} are flagged as {{abnormal_candidate_admission}}, you may be a candidate for admission to help settle an {{overactive_immune_system_thyroid}}.

**{{thyroid_cognitive_dysfunction_consideration}}** When considering the {{risk_cognitive_dysfunction_thyroid}}, {{thyroid_support_essential}}. Though your {{tsh_not_necessarily_abnormal}} is not necessarily {{abnormal_optimal_cognition}}, it may not be {{optimal_cognition_thyroid}}. Those with additional symptoms ({{temperature_dysregulation_hair_loss}}, etc.) may consider a {{low_dose_thyroid_medicine}} from your {{pcp_telemedicine_consultation_thyroid}}. {{additional_fees_thyroid_consultation}}. {{low_tsh_thyroid_function}} Thyroid function is essential for {{optimal_cognition_tsh_optimization}} and your {{tsh_level_suggests_opportunity}} suggests there is an opportunity to optimize. Please schedule a time to {{consult_primary_care_thyroid}} about your {{tsh_level_optimal_parameters}}. An optimal {{tsh_cognition_parameters}} for {{cognitive_function_thyroid_history}} and your {{history_suggests_thyroid_medicine}} suggests you take {{thyroid_medicine_dose_increase}}. {{tsh_exceeds_optimal_parameters}} Your {{tsh_exceeds_optimal_cognition}} exceeds the optimal {{parameters_cognitive_function_history}} and your {{history_suggests_dose_increase}} suggests you take {{thyroid_medicine_optimization}}. {{need_increase_dose_tsh_optimization}}
