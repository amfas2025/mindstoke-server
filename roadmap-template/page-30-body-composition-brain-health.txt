# Body Weight Can Be A Predictor of Brain Health

Total body weight can be a {{sensitive_topic_want_approach}} and we want to {{approach_respectfully_underweight_risk}} If you are {{underweight_risk_certain_conditions}} you are at {{risk_certain_conditions_negatively}} that {{negatively_impact_brain_health_same}} The same goes for {{being_overweight_recognize_bmi}} being overweight. We recognize that {{bmi_simply_way_measure}} is simply one way to {{measure_body_weight_not_necessarily}} body weight, but it does {{not_necessarily_reflect_true}} reflect the {{true_percentages_muscle_mass}}.

## **Body Weight Often Correlates with Brain Health**
