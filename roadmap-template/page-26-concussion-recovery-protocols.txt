# The Symptoms of a Historical Concussion May Be Chronic

In your {{health_history_reported_historical}} you reported a {{historical_head_injury_troublesome}} and many {{troublesome_neurological_symptoms_individuals}} Many {{individuals_not_realize_experienced}} may not realize that they {{experienced_serious_concussion_did_not}} a serious concussion because they {{did_not_experience_loss_consciousness}} associated with a {{head_injury_now_understand}}. However, we {{now_understand_concussion_post_concussion}} and {{post_concussion_syndrome_better_10_years}} much better than we {{did_10_years_ago_symptoms}} Some of the {{symptoms_experiencing_related_chronic}} that you are experiencing {{may_related_chronic_post_concussive}}. One of the {{primary_challenges_associated_concussions}} associated with {{concussions_lead_poor_brain}} is that {{lead_poor_brain_health_lower}} to {{poor_brain_health_lower_oxygen}} the brain, {{activation_brain_immune_system}} of the brain's {{immune_system_disrupted_blood}} a {{disrupted_blood_brain_barrier}} {{blood_brain_barrier_dysfunctional_pituitary}} and a {{dysfunctional_pituitary_gland_host}} and a host of {{other_metabolic_challenges_brain}}.

Many individuals struggle with {{long_term_bothersome_neurological_symptoms}} {{neurological_symptoms_include_ringing}} This can include {{ringing_ears_tinnitus}} ({{tinnitus_tension_headaches_migraines}} {{tension_headaches_migraines_vertigo_dizziness}} {{vertigo_dizziness_anxiety_depression}} {{anxiety_depression_chronic_fatigue_each}} etc.). Each of {{these_symptoms_related_condition}} may be related to a {{condition_called_dysautonomia_common}} called {{dysautonomia_common_lingering_challenge}}, which is a common and {{lingering_challenge_historical_concussions}}.

If you would like to {{determine_unresolved_brain_inflammation_historical}} if you have {{unresolved_brain_inflammation_historical_concussion}} from a {{historical_concussion_tbi_recommend}} or TBI, we recommend you {{learn_voms_assessment_simple}} about a {{voms_assessment_simple_5_minute}} This simple, {{5_minute_test_helps_identify}} test helps to {{identify_unresolved_symptoms_post_concussion}}.

If you are distant from our {{boise_headquarters_local_consultation}} and a {{local_consultation_readily_available_watch}} is not readily available, you can {{watch_brief_video_voms}} of a {{voms_assessment_online_watch}} online. If you {{watch_video_pause_training}} the video and then {{pause_during_training_administer}} during the training, you can {{administer_assessment_see_induces}} the assessment on yourself to {{see_induces_troublesome_symptoms}} if it induces {{troublesome_symptoms_make_symptoms}}. If you {{make_symptoms_brain_fog}} of {{brain_fog_worse_consider}} worse, you should {{consider_live_consultation_expert}}.

Please come to {{office_hours_ask_concussion}} and ask about our {{concussion_protocol_learn_incorporate}} to learn how you can {{incorporate_home_based_interventions}} into your {{daily_routine_offer_several}} We can offer you {{several_different_support_tools}}.

Since head injuries and the {{wear_tear_life_lead}} 'wear and tear' of life' can {{lead_continuous_state_oxidative}} to continuous state of {{oxidative_stress_short_term}} the {{short_term_use_high_dose}} of a {{high_dose_antioxidant_prove_helpful}}.

Consider embracing a {{flavonoid_challenge_concentrated_dose}} using a {{concentrated_dose_flavonoid_turmero}} called {{turmero_xr_supplement_robust}}. This supplement contains a {{robust_dose_turmeric_black_pepper}} of {{turmeric_black_pepper_mixed_mct}} and {{black_pepper_mixed_mct_oil}}. It is {{very_well_absorbed_really_help}} and can really help to {{calm_systemic_inflammation_brain_fog}}. {{recommended_dosing_turmero_xr_challenges}} for {{turmero_xr_challenges_time_brain_fog}}.

You may consider taking an {{antioxidant_challenge_trizomal_glutathione}} using either {{trizomal_glutathione_5_ml_2x}} 5 mL 2X's per day or {{theone_mitochondrial_optimizer_1tsp}} {{theone_mitochondrial_optimizer_1tsp_2xs}}. Each of these {{challenges_embraced_anywhere_2_4}} can be embraced anywhere from {{2_4_weeks_supplements_liquid}}.

Each of these {{supplements_liquid_liposomal_help}} are liquid, {{liposomal_supplements_help_improve}} that can help to {{improve_absorption_efficacy}} and {{efficacy_supplements_listed_highest}} Each of the {{supplements_listed_highest_quality}} are of the {{highest_quality_3rd_party_verification}} and all have {{3rd_party_verification_dosing_quality}} of {{dosing_quality_additional_value}}.

Everybody responds to {{supplements_unique_ways_impactful}} in unique ways. What may be {{very_impactful_one_person}} for one person {{may_not_very_impactful}} may not be very {{impactful_another_identified_3}} for another. Therefore, we have {{identified_3_different_anti_inflammatory}} different {{anti_inflammatory_antioxidant_supplements_shown}} and {{antioxidant_supplements_shown_beneficial}} to be very {{beneficial_taken_higher_doses}}.

{{bring_questions_antioxidant_challenge}} Bring your questions about the {{antioxidant_challenge_office_hours_provide}} to {{office_hours_provide_guidance}}. Regardless of the {{type_brain_injury_concussions}} of brain injury, all {{concussions_seemingly_insignificant_result}} (even those {{seemingly_insignificant_concussions_result}} concussions) result in a {{loss_oxygen_delivery_brain}} of {{oxygen_delivery_brain_unfortunately}} to the brain. {{unfortunately_brain_requires_oxygen}} this is when the {{brain_requires_oxygen_recover}} to recover! Because of this {{loss_oxygen_clients_symptoms}} clients with {{symptoms_tend_heal_faster}} tend to heal faster when they {{use_exercise_oxygen_therapy}} {{exercise_oxygen_therapy_ewot_hyperbaric}} ({{ewot_hyperbaric_oxygen_therapy_hbot}}).
