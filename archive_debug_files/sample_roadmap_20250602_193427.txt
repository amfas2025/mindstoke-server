## **APO E Genetic Profile and Your Risk for Oxidative Stress**

Your APO E Genotype is E3/E4. Your APO E genetics has some predictive value for increased risk of cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disease. Your GLUTATHIONE level was 180 and many neurologists suggest the optimal range may exceed 300 ug/mL. GLUTATHIONE reflects your ability to calm oxidative stress.

Your GLUTATHIONE level is very low, which is suggestive of a high level of oxidative stress.

Consider the following:

You have one of the APO E4 genes that may convey greater risk of Alzheimer's. However, genetics convey susceptibility, but they are not determinative... you can influence their expression! You will want to be particularly thoughtful about embracing a healthy lifestyle, using high quality supplements, hormone optimization, and toxicity. Details about each of these interventions will follow.

You have the APO E E4/E3 genetic variant, which DOES increase your risk for Alzheimer's. However, genetics convey susceptibility, but they are not determinative... you can influence their expression! You will want to be particularly thoughtful about embracing a healthy lifestyle, using high quality supplements, hormone optimization, and toxicity. Details about each of these interventions will follow.

You have both APO E4 genes that convey greater risk of Alzheimer's. However, genetics convey susceptibility, but they are not determinative... you can influence their expression! You will want to be particularly thoughtful about embracing a healthy lifestyle, using high quality supplements, hormone optimization, and toxicity. Details about each of these interventions will follow.

You do not have the APO E genetic risk for Alzheimer's Dementia. You should consider ADDITIONAL IMMUNE SYSTEM TESTING and/or TOXICITY TESTING to clarify your risk for TOXIC CONTRIBUTORS of neurodegenerative disease.
- To support a healthy antioxidant response, you are encouraged to use 2 supplements to support the natural production of glutathione. These supplements may help to lower the impact of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) by using a combination of unique products listed below.
- Please start **NAC 600 mg 2X's per day**. This product is inexpensive and supports GLUTATHIONE recycling by improving cysteine levels.
- Please start **GLUTATHIONE RECYCLER 1 capsule 2 X's/day**. This is a product by Apex Energetics. This supplement contains cordyceps, gotu kola, milk thistle, L-glutamine, and alpha-lipoic acid. All of these have been shown in studies to improve total body GLUTATHIONE stores.
- In addition to the interventions listed above, you may consider taking the GLUTATHIONE CHALLENGE. The purpose of this challenge is to see how you respond physically and cognitively when you rapidly increase your glutathione levels within a short period of time. Please start **TRIZOMAL GLUTATHIONE and use 1 tsp (5 mL) 3-4 X's per day for 1-2 weeks**. This is a supplement from Apex Energetics. If you complete the challenge and notice a significant improvement in the way you feel (less brain fog, more energy, less sickness), then it confirms that contributors of oxidative stress are negatively impacting your health. Start learning how to reduce oxidative stress in your life. This would be a good question to bring to Office Hours.

## **MTHFR Genetics & Methylation Support**

MTHFR GENETIC PROFILES- There are certain genetic variants that impact a person's ability to synthesize B-vitamins. This often correlates with a group of genetic variants called MTHFR genetics. If you have one or more of these genetic variants, you may benefit from a particular form of methylated B-vitamins. Your MTHFR Genotype shows a C/T and an A/A variant.

The C/T and A/A alleles are variants suggestive of methylation challenges. You may benefit from taking a supplement like METHYLPRO indefinitely. Given your genetic MTHFR profile, you are encouraged to verify that you are taking a methylated B complex supplement.
- The C677T allele is a variant suggestive of methylation challenges and you may benefit from taking a supplement like METHYLPRO indefinitely. Given your genetic MTHFR profile, you are encouraged to verify that you are taking a methylated B complex supplement.
- The C677T allele is a variant suggestive of methylation challenges and you may benefit from taking a supplement like METHYLPRO indefinitely. Given your genetic MTHFR profile, you are encouraged to verify that you are taking a methylated B complex supplement.
- The A1298C allele is a variant suggestive of methylation challenges and you may benefit from taking a supplement like METHYLPRO indefinitely. Given your genetic MTHFR profile, you are encouraged to verify that you are taking a methylated B complex supplement.
- Due to your METHYLATION genetics, you may consider complete abstinence from ALCOHOL. Though you may not be a heavy drinker, and you may consume very infrequently, ALCOHOL is an 'inflammogen' and can exacerbate methylation challenges in your body and alter the detox pathways specific to the liver.
- Consider starting methylated B complex supplement. You can choose between 2 high quality supplements. Please consider SUPER METHYL-SP from Apex Energetics. The dosing is 1 capsule/day. We also recommend METHYLPRO; B-COMPLEX + 5 mg L-METHYLFOLATE 1 tablet/day. You may choose between these two options.
- This recommendation is offered considering your history of depression and/or your MTHFR genetics.
- You may choose to use SUPER METHYL-SP from Apex Energetics or METHYLPRO; B-COMPLEX + 5 mg L-METHYLFOLATE 1 tablet/day in place of your current B-COMPLEX supplement because of your genetic MTHFR profile.
- Given your genetic MTHFR profile, you may consider taking a methylated B-complex vitamin indefinitely.

MTHFR GENETIC PROFILES- There are certain genetic variants that impact a person's ability to synthesize B-vitamins. This often correlates with a group of genetic variants called MTHFR genetics. If you have one or more of these genetic variants, you may benefit from a particular form of methylated B-vitamins. Your MTHFR Genotype shows neither of the most troublesome variants.

## **Vitamin & Mineral Optimization**

Your baseline Vitamin D level is 32. The optimal level is suggested to be 60-80 ng/mL.

Your VITAMIN D level is suboptimal, and supplementation is recommended. Please note the section in your Guidebook about the importance of, and dosing recommendation to optimize VITAMIN D.

Since your VITAMIN D was < 30, you are encouraged to supplement with 10,000 iu of VITAMIN D3 per day and then recheck your levels in 90 days.

Since your VITAMIN D was 30-39, you are encouraged to supplement with 8,000 iu of VITAMIN D3 per day, and then recheck your levels in 90 days.

Since your VITAMIN D was 40-49, you are encouraged to supplement with 4,000 iu of VITAMIN D3 per day, and then recheck your levels in 90 days.

Since your VITAMIN D was 50-59, you are encouraged to supplement with 2,000 iu of VITAMIN D3 per day, and then recheck your levels in 90 days.

**Vitamin D Optimization:** Your baseline Vitamin D level is .

Your VITAMIN D level falls within the optimal parameters and no additional intervention is recommended.

Since your VITAMIN D was 40-49, supplement with 6,000 IU of VITAMIN D3 daily and recheck in 90 days.

Since your VITAMIN D was 30-39, supplement with 8,000 IU of VITAMIN D3 daily and recheck in 90 days.

Since your VITAMIN D was < 30, supplement with 10,000 IU of VITAMIN D3 daily and recheck in 90 days.

This level is close to the optimal parameters and though no additional intervention is recommended, you may want to check your VITAMIN D level a few times per year to make sure that it does not drop.

This level falls very close to the optimal parameters and no additional intervention is recommended. You are encouraged to continue your current VITAMIN D supplement.

In your health history, you indicated that you are taking a VITAMIN D supplement. However, your serum levels remain suboptimal. Please note the section in your Guidebook about the importance of, and dosing recommendation to optimize your VITAMIN D levels.

Since your VITAMIN D was < 30, you are encouraged to add an additional 10,000 iu/day to your current dosing for 90 days and then recheck in 90 days.

Since your VITAMIN D was 30-39, you are encouraged to add an additional 8,000 iu/day to your current dosing for 90 days and then recheck in 90 days.

Since your VITAMIN D was 40-49, you are encouraged to add an additional 4,000 iu/day to your current dosing for 90 days and then recheck in 90 days.

Since your VITAMIN D was 50-59, you are encouraged to add an additional 2,000 iu/day to your current dosing for 90 days and then recheck in 90 days.

Your combined **Vitamin E** level is 8.5 mg/L. The optimal level is suggested to be 12-20 mg/L.

This level falls within the optimal parameters and no additional intervention is recommended.

Consider starting a supplement called **COMPLETE E** from the company Metabolic Response Modifier. The standard dose is 1 capsule/day. This supplement is a comprehensive formula that provides all eight naturally occurring forms of VITAMIN E. This supplement includes both tocopherol and tocotrienol forms of VITAMIN E.

Your **VITAMIN E** level is starting to trend quite elevated. It may not be helpful for this level to continue to increase. If you are taking a **VITAMIN E** supplement, you may want to speak with your primary care provider about this level. **VITAMIN E** is a fat-soluble vitamin that can be associated with adverse outcomes if it gets too elevated.

Your baseline **OMEGACHECKÂ®** value was 4.2 % and risk reduction begins when your value is > 5.4 % by weight.

Your **OMEGA 6:3** ratio was 12-to-1. This means that your **OMEGA-6** fatty acid levels were found to be 12 x's more prevalent than your **OMEGA-3** fatty acid levels. We recommend striving for a ratio as close to a 4:1 ratio (or lower). In fact, a 1:1 ratio is considered amazing, but it is difficult to achieve with the Standard American Diet!

Your **ARACHIDONIC ACID-to-EPA** ratio was 9.5 and we'd like to see this ratio < 8.0. Since **ARACHIDONIC ACID** can be a marker of trending inflammation and **EPA** can help suppress or optimize inflammation, we like this ratio to trend low in chronic disease. This value often becomes optimized when your **OMEGA-3** ratios are optimized.

Your **ARACHIDONIC ACID** level was 11.2 and we'd like to see this value < 10. This value often becomes optimized when your **OMEGA-3** ratios are optimized.

**OmegaCheck Optimization:** Your OmegaCheck value of 4.2% is below the optimal threshold of 5.4%. Consider high-quality omega-3 supplementation.

**Arachidonic Acid:EPA Ratio:** Your ratio of 9.5 is elevated (target <8.0). This suggests inflammatory dominance. Omega-3 supplementation should help balance this ratio.

**Omega-6:3 Ratio Optimization:** Your ratio of 12:1 indicates excess omega-6 relative to omega-3. Focus on:
- High-quality fish oil (Nordic Naturals Pro-Omega 2000 or equivalent)
- Reduce omega-6 oils (vegetable oils, processed foods)
- Increase fatty fish consumption (salmon, sardines, mackerel)
- Consider flaxseed, chia seeds, and walnuts for plant-based omega-3

**OMEGA-3 CHALLENGE Protocol:** A history of concussion, a TBI, or a very low **OMEGA 6:3 INDEX** justifies taking the **OMEGA-3 CHALLENGE** as outlined by Dr. Michael Lewis. **The OMEGA CHALLENGE** includes taking **10,000 mg of combined EPA and DHA OMEGA-3 per day for 1-2 months**. This aggressive protocol is designed to rapidly optimize omega-3 status and support neurological recovery. After the challenge period, return to maintenance dosing of 3 caps per day.

**Neurological Omega-3 Optimization:** Your **OMEGA-3** levels are quite suboptimal for neurological functioning, and you are encouraged to start a high-potency, high-quality **OMEGA-3 supplement**. Recommended brands include **Triple Strength OMEGA-3 FISH OIL** by Sports Research (Costco), **PRO-OMEGA 2000** or **ULTIMATE OMEGA 2X** by Nordic Naturals. The maintenance dose is 3 capsules daily. If you prefer a liquid **OMEGA-3** supplement, consider **PHYTO BRAIN-E**. The recommended dose is 1-2 tsp, 2x's/day. This supplement has a very concentrated amount of **DHA** and is recommended to those with a history of head trauma or neurodegenerative disease.

**Taking an OMEGA:** Though you are currently supplementing, you are not yet at the evidence-based goal for the 4:1, **OMEGA 6:3 RATIO**. You are encouraged to look at the label of your **OMEGA-3** to make sure you are taking a high-potency, triglyceride-based **OMEGA-3** supplement, and you should increase your maintenance dosing to 2 capsules, 2 x's/day. Recommended brands include **Triple Strength OMEGA-3 FISH OIL** by Sports Research (Costco), **PRO-OMEGA 2000** or **ULTIMATE OMEGA 2X** by Nordic Naturals. The maintenance dose is 3 caps per day. If you prefer a liquid **OMEGA-3** supplement, consider **PHYTO BRAIN-E**. The recommended dose is 1-2 tsp, 2x's/day. This supplement has a very concentrated amount of **DHA** and is recommended to those with a history of head trauma or neurodegenerative disease.

**Zinc Optimization:** Consider zinc supplementation for immune function and wound healing.

**Magnesium Support:** Your magnesium levels suggest supplementation. Use magnesium glycinate for better absorption.

**Magnesium RBC Optimization:** Your baseline **MAGNESIUM RBC** level is 4.8. The optimal level is suggested to be > 5.2 mg/dL.

This level falls below the optimal parameters and supplementation is recommended. Consider starting **MAGNESIUM THREONATE 2000 mg at night**. This form of magnesium is specifically designed to cross the blood-brain barrier and support neurological function. Alternative forms include **MAGNESIUM GLYCINATE** or **MAGNESIUM TAURATE** for better absorption and reduced digestive side effects.

Consider starting **MAGNESIUM THREONATE 2000 mg at night**. This form of magnesium is specifically designed to cross the blood-brain barrier and support neurological function.

This level falls within the optimal parameters and no additional intervention is recommended at this time.

## **Copper to Zinc Ratio Analysis**

Your **C:Z RATIO** is 1.5. The optimal ratio is â¤ 1.4.

Your **C:Z RATIO** is trending elevated. Consider starting **ZINC PICCOLINATE 30-50 mg** & **VITAMIN C 500 mg/day**.

High copper to zinc ratios can contribute to inflammation, immune dysfunction, and oxidative stress. Zinc supplementation helps balance this ratio while supporting immune function and reducing inflammation.

**Masterclass:** https://community.amindforallseasons.com/c/masterclass/sections/387368/lessons/1506605

**Enhanced Copper-Zinc Protocol:** Your **C:Z RATIO** is significantly elevated. Consider starting **ZINC PICCOLINATE 30-50 mg** & **LIPOSOMAL VITAMIN C + R-LIPOIC ACID 4 pumps daily**.

The liposomal delivery system provides superior absorption and bioavailability compared to traditional vitamin C. R-lipoic acid enhances the antioxidant effects and supports optimal copper-zinc balance at the cellular level.

This ratio falls within the optimal parameters and no additional intervention is recommended at this time.

## **Selenium Optimization**

**Selenium** level is 110.0. The optimal is > 125 ug/L. **SELENIUM** is a helpful antioxidant and cofactor in many biochemical reactions in the body. Researchers have identified the role of **SELENIUM** in optimizing immune function, and it helps to reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.

Your **SELENIUM** level is too low for optimal neurological function. Consider starting **CLEAR WAY COFACTORS 2 capsules/day** to help raise your functional **SELENIUM** level.Consider starting a selenium supplement to help raise your selenium levels. **SELENIUM** plays a crucial role in supporting glutathione peroxidase, one of the body's most important antioxidant enzymes.

**Recommended dosing:** 200 mcg daily of selenium (selenomethionine form preferred for better absorption).

This level falls within the optimal parameters and no additional intervention is recommended at this time.

This level falls within the optimal parameters and no additional intervention is recommended.

## **Metabolic & Blood Sugar Management**

Your fasting **BLOOD SUGAR** was 105.0. The goal is < 100 mg/dL.

baseline **INSULIN** was 12.0. The goal is < 7. **INSULIN** levels should be very low when you have not eaten.

Your baseline **HOMA-IR** calculation is 3.11. The goal is < 1.2).

Your baseline **A1c** was 5.8. The goal is < 5.6, lower if you have an **APO E4** gene. We encourage our clients to strive for a level <5.3 if you have both copies of the **APO E4** gene variant.
- You will find excellent guidance to help you with meal planning to improve your cognitive health. That guidance is summarized in the next section. However, the following considerations are offered to your blood sugar or metabolic labs.

**Continuous Glucose Monitoring for Brain Health**
- Have you ever heard of a **CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITOR (CGM)**? If not, you have probably seen an individual with diabetes wearing a blood sugar sensor on the arm. Wearing a **CGM** is one of the best ways to evaluate the impact of your diet on your metabolic health. Inquire with your coach for instructions on how to obtain and apply a **CGM**. We recommend that every participant of The Enhance ProtocolÂ® (including all non-diabetics) wear a **CGM** to learn about how their diet impacts their metabolic health.
- Please attend Office Hours to learn how you can get access and use a **CGM** sensor.

Your genetics suggest that you may be at elevated risk for insulin resistance in the brain.
- The correlation between serum **KETONE** levels and cognitive health is so interrelated, **you may consider taking a KETONE supplement daily as an added way to provide a powerful fuel for the brain.** Research suggests ketones readily pass the blood brain barrier and they can be anti-inflammatory. There are many commercially available products. Some products offer **KETONE SALTS**, and others offer **KETONE ESTERS**. You may consider dedicating one of your upcoming Office Hours to learn more about how **KETONE** supplement may support your goals.
- Individuals who experience **CHRONIC ALLERGIES** and who consume **ALCOHOL**, may have a histamine intolerance. Foods that are fermented may induce or trigger a histamine response. Consider a **LOW HISTAMINE DIET** to help settle your allergies. Avoid common foods that are fermented (yogurt, sauerkraut, kimchi, kombucha, and all forms of alcohols). This is another good reason to eliminate alcohol from your daily routine.
- Individuals who experience **GI HEADACHES** and **CHRONIC ALLERGIES**, should learn more about **MAST CELL ACTIVATION**, and consider a series of interventions to calm the immune system to see if these symptoms improve.
- You have enough triggers in your personal history to introduce you to **MAST CELL ACTIVATION**. Overactivation of mast cells often leads to brain fog, multiple chemical sensitivities, allergies, rashes, irritable bowels, insomnia, and a host of additional challenges. Please review the section on **MAST CELL ACTIVATION** and consider if you have symptoms such that it merits additional investigation. You may choose to visit your primary care provider, or you may choose to schedule a **TELEMEDICINE CONSULTATION** to review your symptoms. **Additional fees may apply.**
- Your blood sugar markers would suggest you could benefit from starting a few supplements to address insulin resistance. These include **GLYSEN** and **GLYCOBERINE-MX** by Apex Energetics. **The recommended dose is 1 capsule of each of these supplements, 2 x's per day.** These supplements contains inositol, chromium, vanadium, berberine, alpha lipoic acid, burdock, rose hips, and a number of other great ingredients that can help to lower insulin resistance and improve blood sugars.
- Alzheimer's is often referred to as 'Diabetes Type 3.' Since cognitive dysfunction is often impacted by insulin resistance in the brain, focus on the interventions that will help lower your blood sugar and improve your insulin sensitivity. A thoughtful, brain-healthy diet is rich in whole foods, colorful vegetables and loaded with vitamins, fiber, and healthy fats. Intentional meal planning that incorporates intermittent fasting, low carb and **KETO** principles often promotes improved cognition.
- There are many researchers impressed that elevated blood sugars may have a stronger correlation than your genetics to induce brain atrophy. A **KETOGENIC DIET** may be extremely beneficial. You may consider purchasing a **KETONE METER** to help you learn how to understand the nuances of metabolic optimization. Your coach can teach you how to use a Freestyle Libre Monitor to quickly identify and track blood sugars without having to stick your finger.
- A very thoughtful diet that is rich in whole foods, colorful vegetables and loaded with vitamins, fiber, and healthy fats are a hallmark of a brain-healthy diet. Though you do not appear to have diabetes, a diet high in sugars or starchy carbohydrates is often related to a diet low in micronutrients.

**Blood Sugar Management:** Your glucose levels indicate metabolic dysfunction requiring intervention.

**Insulin Resistance Protocol:** Your insulin levels suggest insulin resistance. Implement:
- Intermittent fasting (16:8 protocol)
- Low glycemic index foods
- Regular resistance training

**HOMA-IR Score:** Your calculated HOMA-IR indicates insulin resistance requiring metabolic intervention.

**Long-term Blood Sugar:** Your HbA1c requires monitoring and lifestyle modification.

**Diabetes Prevention:** Based on your metabolic markers, diabetes prevention protocols are essential.

---

## **Inflammatory Markers & Management**

**C-Reactive Protein:** Your hsCRP level of 4.2 indicates systemic inflammation requiring intervention.

**High Inflammation:** CRP above 3.0 mg/L indicates significant inflammatory burden.

**Compound Inflammation Risk:** Your combination of elevated CRP and low Omega-3 status creates compounded cardiovascular and neurological risk.

If you are not taking an **OMEGA-3**, consider starting a high-quality, triglyceride-based **OMEGA-3** supplement. **OMEGA-3's** are considered very anti-inflammatory and often help to calm systemic inflammation. You are encouraged to continue a high-potency, high-quality **OMEGA-3** supplements. Recommended brands include **Triple Strength OMEGA-3 FISH OIL** by Sports Research (Costco), **PRO-OMEGA 2000** or **ULTIMATE OMEGA 2X** by Nordic Naturals. **The maintenance dose is 3 caps per day**.

## **â'd Homocysteine Levels Can Impair Brain Function**

Your HOMOCYSTEINE level was 13.5. Since HOMOCYSTEINE is linked to inflammation, we recommend a goal level < 7 umol/L. An elevated HOMOCYSTEINE level correlates with both heart disease and cognitive disorders. By improving your HOMOCYSTEINE levels, you effectively lower your risk of both disease states. Elevated levels are often related to sub-optimal levels of B vitamins.

Your VITAMIN B12 level was 850.0. The goal is > 1000 pg/mL to best support brain health.

Your FOLATE level (often called folic acid) is 12.0. The goal is > 15 ng/mL to best support brain health.

**Masterclass:** https://community.amindforallseasons.com/c/masterclass/sections/387368/lessons/1506604
- Consider starting TRIMETHYLGLYCINE 1000 mg/day. We recommend adding this supplement to a methylated B complex when HOMOCYSTEINE levels are > 12.
- Consider starting a supplement called CREATINE MONOHYDRATE. The standard dose is 5 grams per day. We recommend adding this supplement to a methylated B complex and trimethylglycine when HOMOCYSTEINE levels are > 15. CREATINE comes in a chewable or a powder form that can be mixed in a drink. It can help improve energy levels and help to support HOMOCYSTEINE recycling.

## **Hormone Optimization Can Improve Your Brain Function**

Many individuals do not realize that there is an optimal hormone level for brain health. When hormone levels drop, brain function is diminished. This section focuses on the importance of your hormone levels and their potential impact on brain health.

---

## **Thyroid Function and Brain Health**

Your baseline **TSH** was 3.20. The goal level for optimizing cognition is 0.4 - 2.5 uIU/mL.

Your baseline **FREE T3** was 3.00. The goal level for optimizing cognition is 3.2 - 4.2 uIU/mL.

Your baseline **FREE T4** was 1.10. The goal level for optimizing cognition is 1.3 - 1.8 uIU/mL.

Your baseline **REVERSE T3** was 16. The goal level for optimizing cognition is < 15 uIU/mL.

Your baseline **THYROID PEROXIDASE (TPO)** antibody level was 45. **TPO** is an antibody produced by your immune system targeting your thyroid gland. When the **TPO** level is >34, we begin to consider your risk for an autoimmune disorder called **HASHIMOTO'S THYROIDITIS**.

Your **THYROGLOBULIN ANTIBODY (TgAb)** level was 2.5. When **TgAb** levels are >1, this is an additional sign that you have risk for a variant of **HASHIMOTOS THYROIDITIS**. When either of the thyroid antibody levels are flagged as elevated, you may be a candidate for additional diagnostic tests or interventions to help settle an overactive immune system.
- **Thyroid function is essential for optimal cognition and your **TSH** level suggests there is an opportunity to optimize. Please schedule a time to consult with your primary care provider about your **TSH** level. An optimal **TSH** for cognitive function is 0.4 - 2.5 uIU/mL.**
- **Your **TSH** exceeds the optimal parameters for cognitive function and your history suggests you take thyroid medicine. You may need to increase your dose.**
- When considering the risk of cognitive dysfunction, thyroid support is essential. Though your **TSH** is not necessarily abnormal, it may not be optimal for cognitive health. Those with additional symptoms (chronically cold or those with temperature dysregulation, hair loss, dry skin, struggles to lose weight, constipation, etc.) may consider a low dose of thyroid medicine. This would require a prescription from your **PCP**, or a **TELEMEDICINE** consultation with a provider from **AMFAS**. **Additional fees may apply.**
- A superficial review of your **THYROID FUNCTION** would not predict major concerns, but your **TSH** and **REVERSE T3** are trending the wrong way. They may be suggestive of a process of impaired thyroid function. Your **FREE T3** level was  pg/mL. The optimal range is > 3.6 pg/mL. **Your **REVERSE T3** level is elevated at  ng/dL.** These values fall outside of the optimal parameters for thyroid function, and you may be a candidate for a trial of a prescription medicine that optimizes these thyroid hormone levels. **You may benefit from a prescription should you choose to optimize thyroid function. Please schedule a time to discuss this recommendation with your **PCP** or schedule a **TELEMEDICINE** consultation with the medical director at **AMFAS** to talk about your options.**
- An elevated **REVERSE T3** level may be suggestive of a process that impairs functional thyroid. **REVERSE T3** is a non-functional stereoisomer of **T3**. This has the potential of blocking **FREE T3** receptors and diminishing the effectiveness of **FREE T3**. Though the precise reason your body makes more **REVERSE T3** is unknown, it can be related to low levels of **VITAMIN B12**, **IRON**, **FERRITIN**, or elevated levels of **CORTISOL**. You may consider testing **IRON** and **FERRITIN** levels at your quarterly blood draw.
- You may have some symptoms of **AUTOIMMUNE THYROIDITIS** and additional autoimmunity testing may be helpful. Because you have laboratory markers of **AUTOIMMUNE THYROIDITIS**, you may choose to research a compounded medication called **LOW DOSE NALTREXONE (LDN)**. Information about **LDN** is provided later in your Guidebook. Your family doctor may also provide detailed information if you think this may be an intervention that you would like to implement. **If your family physician is unfamiliar with **LOW DOSE NALTREXONE**, you may benefit from a **TELEMEDICINE** consultation with one of the providers at **AMFAS**.**
- You are also encouraged to begin learning about the **AUTOIMMUNE PALEO DIET**. You can learn more about this dietary approach by attending Office Hours.

---

## **Hormone Optimization Protocols**

---

## **Neurologically Active Hormones**

**Pregnenolone Support:** Consider pregnenolone supplementation (100mg at night) to optimize this "mother hormone."

**DHEA-S Status:** Your DHEA-S level of  is within optimal parameters.

**DHEA-S Support:** Consider 7-Keto DHEA supplementation (100mg at night) for neurological support.

**DHEA & Cardiovascular Health:** Low DHEA-S levels correlate with increased cardiovascular disease risk.

---

## **Medical History & Specialized Protocols**

**Parkinson's Support:** Focus on dental health, toxicity reduction, and protein timing with Sinemet if applicable.

---

## **Advanced Cardiovascular Protocols**

**Cholesterol Management:** Your cholesterol level of  requires optimization through lifestyle and targeted interventions.

**Coronary Calcium Score:** Consider CAC scoring before initiating statin therapy for accurate cardiovascular risk assessment.

**Cardiovascular Support:** Consider Vitamin K2 (MK-7) supplementation for cardiovascular health.

**Statin Considerations:** If taking statins, ensure CoQ10 supplementation to prevent muscle-related side effects.

**Low Triglycerides:** Extremely low triglycerides may indicate systemic toxicity requiring evaluation.

---

## **Compound Risk Conditions**

**Root Canal + Inflammation:** Your combination of root canal history and elevated CRP creates compounded inflammatory risk.

**Neurological Risk Triad:** Your combination of alcohol consumption, elevated homocysteine, and low B12 creates compounded neurological risk.

**Sleep & Cognitive Decline:** Your sleep apnea combined with cognitive symptoms requires immediate intervention.

**Metabolic + Genetic Risk:** Your diabetes combined with APO E4 genetics creates additive Alzheimer's risk requiring aggressive intervention.

---

## **Implementation Strategy**

1. **Start with Foundation:** Address vitamin D, omega-3, and basic metabolic health first
2. **Phase 2:** Implement hormone optimization and advanced protocols
3. **Phase 3:** Address specialized conditions and compound risks
4. **Monitor Progress:** Retest labs in 90 days to assess improvement

**Energy Support:** Consider ATP Fuel supplementation for mitochondrial energy production.

---

**Remember:** This roadmap is personalized based on your unique biochemistry. Implement changes gradually and monitor your response. Schedule follow-up consultation if you have questions about implementation.

*Generated by A Mind For All Seasons - Personalized Brain Health Optimization*

## **Cardiovascular Risk and Cholesterol Levels**

Your **TOTAL CHOLESTEROL** level was 220.0. While cardiologists like to see **TOTAL CHOLESTEROL** levels < 200, we are a little more liberal with this marker.

Your **TRIGLYCERIDE** level was 160.0. The optimal level is thought to be <150, especially if you have insulin resistance, diabetes or elevated liver enzymes. This cholesterol marker is highly influenced by diet. In fact, it is most influenced by your carbohydrate (sugar) intake. If you want to lower your **TRIGLYCERIDE** levels, stop eating sugar!

Your **HDL CHOLESTEROL**, which is often considered 'the good cholesterol,' was 45.0. The optimal is >40 and the most significant way to raise this level is daily exercise.

Your **LDL CHOLESTEROL**, which is often considered 'the bad cholesterol' was 135.0. Cardiologists often use your **LDL CHOLESTEROL** to predict your need for cholesterol lowering medication like **STATIN** therapy. We are more cautious with **STATIN** medications due to their risk of causing brain fog, insulin resistance, and decreased **CoQ10** levels.

Your **TRIG-to-HDL RATIO** was 3.56. The optimal **RATIO** is <2. Anything above 2 is a sign of insulin resistance.

Too often, we pin our views of good vascular health on low cholesterol levels. However, there are a few other risk factors that contribute to good cardiovascular health and brain health. We have summarized these risk factors in a masterclass.

**Masterclass:** https://community.amindforallseasons.com/c/masterclass/sections/387363/lessons/1441392
- We recommend lifestyle as the primary method for optimizing your cholesterol before you default to cholesterol lowering medicine. The eating plan summarized previously is an excellent starting point to optimize your cholesterol levels.
- We recommend lifestyle as the primary method for optimizing your cholesterol.
- Elevated cholesterol levels may reflect a metabolic syndrome and may predict additional risk of poor vascular health. However, many providers rely heavily on **STATINS** to improve cholesterol values and vascular risk without contemplating their impact on brain fog and depletion of **CoQ10**. There are instances where this **STATIN** therapy may be very appropriate. However, at **AMFAS**, we prefer to look at other markers of oxidative or vascular stress **before** immediately jumping into **STATIN** therapy. You may consider completing a **CORONARY ARTERY CALCIUM SCORE**. This is a topic that will help to predict your specific risk for atherosclerosis and is a way to better understand if elevated cholesterol levels are **physiological** or **pathological**. You should attend Office Hours and inquire about this test with our medical director, Randy Vawdrey.
- This test typically costs $100-$200 (depending on your location). A **CAC** score is arguably the best predictor of vascular health.
- Consider starting **MEGAQUINONE** to help support cardiovascular health.
- Curiously, your **TRIGLYCERIDES** are quite low. Not all cholesterol levels are problematic. An uncharacteristically low **TRIGLYCERIDE LEVEL** often correlates with cognitive decline. Dr. Bredesen, a renowned neurologist, has suggested that extremely low **TRIGLYCERIDE** levels may be related to systemic toxicity. Use lifestyle as the primary method for optimizing your cholesterol and do not be afraid to intentionally add healthy fats to your daily meal planning.
- Consider completing the **PRODROME SCAN** blood test to evaluate your **PLASMALOGENS**.
- Your **PLATELET COUNT** was trending elevated, and given you concerns about risk for cognitive decline, your **APO E** genetics, your age, and your metabolic health, you should consider checking a **D-DIMER** and **LEIDEN FACTOR V**. The goal of these tests it rule our risk for clotting disorder or a heightened risk of cerebral vascular disease.

## **Nootropics and Brain Health**

We refer to **NOOTROPICS** as a group of supplements that may serve several distinct functions. Participants use **NOOTROPICS** as cognitive boosters, memory enhancers, memory focus, motivation, memory mood, and cognition. If a **NOOTROPIC** is recommended below, a detailed summary about this recommendation will be offered in the corresponding section of your Guidebook.
- Consider starting an OTC form of a **CHOLINE** supplement. Our favorite brands include **ACETYL-CH ACTIVE** and **PARASYM PLUS**. The standard dose of either supplement is **2 capsules per day** (or a second dose when you need to be cognitively alert). **CHOLINE** may help to support the production of *acetylcholine* (the neurotransmitter associated with cognition). When our clients have an increased risk of cognitive dysfunction, a standard intervention in integrative medicine is to strive to improve **CHOLINE** levels in the brain. **CHOLINE** comes in many forms that are outlined in the summary about nootropics.
- Consider starting **LION'S MANE** powder or capsule **2-3 x's/day**.
- You have reported the use of **CPAP** or **BIPAP** for sleep apnea and you are concerned about cognitive decline. Though we are cautious with medicines for neurological health, you may be a good candidate for a prescription of **MODAFINIL** or **PROVIGIL**. These medicines are used to improve wakefulness, attention, and focus in those with **SLEEP APNEA** or who use **CPAP**. For many, these medicines can be very helpful. This medication requires a prescription. You can ask your **PCP** to weigh in and offer an Rx, or you can bring your questions to Office Hours and schedule a **telemedicine consultation** with one of our providers. **Additional fees may apply.**
- You are encouraged to start a supplement called **NITRIC BALANCE**. The standard dose is **10-20 mL as needed**. This supplement boasts a proprietary blend of nutraceuticals that stimulate the production of **eNOS** and improve blood flow. This supplement is often used as a pre-work out supplement or as an intervention for chronic headaches or migraines.
- You are encouraged to start a supplement called **NEURO2**. The standard dose is **1 capsule, 2 x's per day**. This supplement contains **VINPOCETINE** and is used to support brain health and cerebral blood flow. **VINPOCETINE** is a prescription medicine in many countries outside of the USA but can be used as a supplement in the United States.
- You are encouraged to start a supplement called **NEUROFLAM**. The standard dose is **2 capsules, 2x's per day**. This supplement contains a blend of nutraceutical flavonoid compounds that have been shown to be anti-inflammatory and neurologically stimulating. In animal studies, the ingredients in this supplement have been shown to cross the blood brain barrier, offering direct influence on the immune cells of the brain.
- Consider starting **BRAIN & MEMORY POWER BOOST** **2 capsules, 2x's/day**. Your history reports that you are taking a supplement to try and improve your focus. If you choose to take this supplement, you could take this in lieu of what you are taking now. This is a high-quality supplement to support cognition and may compare it to the supplement you are currently using. Work with your physician or memory coach to compare ingredients and quality. When you have completed the supply of the focus supplement you are currently taking, this may be a great alternative. Consider trying it.
- Consider starting **ACETYL-L-CARNITINE (ALCAR)** **500-1000 mg 2x/day**.
- Consider starting a trial of **TRANSFER FACTORS** as a means of neutralizing viruses that may be contributing to a chronic inflammatory response. We recommend the brand **4Life TRANSFER FACTOR**. The standard dose is **two capsules/day**. Another brand is called **WELLNESS TRANSFER FACTOR**, and their standard dose is **one capsule 2x's/day**. You can purchase this supplement online. Transfer factors are derived from colostrum, and they serve to activate natural killer cells within our immune system.
- Consider starting **BRAIN RESCUE III-** The starting dose is **one packet in the morning for 2 weeks**, and then **every other day**. This supplement is a hallmark intervention for those with a history of brain injury.
- You are encouraged to start a supplement called **NEUROFLAM (K-46)**, a product from Apex Energetics. The dose I recommend is **2 capsules, 2x's/day**. Each of the ingredients in this supplement have been shown to cross the blood brain barrier, and they can have a significant impact at calming neuroinflammation and in helping to heal the blood brain barrier.
- Consider starting **BRAIN RESCUE III-** The starting dose is **one packet in the morning for 2 weeks**, and then **every other day**. This supplement is recommended for those with a history of malabsorption challenges related to surgical weight loss procedures. **Note:** this supplement could disrupt sleep as it contains some natural stimulants. You should use the supplement before **2:00 pm**. If you need that vitamin B supplementation, you should consider an **METHYLFOLATE** supplement. Ask your memory coach for guidance if you have questions.
- Please review the label of your current **OMEGA-3** supplement. Verify that it is a **TRIGLYCERIDE**-derived omega-3 supplement vs. an Ethyl Ester supplement. There is a substantial difference in absorption between these two types of omega-3 supplements. If not, please consider a shift to **PRO-OMEGA** or **ULTIMATE OMEGA 2X** by Nordic Naturals. The standard dose is **3 caps per day**.

## **Please Consider Additional Screening Tests Related to Brain Health**

The extensive panel of labs completed when you start The Enhance ProtocolÂ® is an excellent start to your health screening process to improve cognitive function. However, it is only a start! There are other screening tests that we recommend to help you identify silent health conditions that may impact your brain health or compromise your cognitive function. Though this list is not intended to be comprehensive, it is intended to help you to start thinking about the relationship of these tests to your brain health. Consider the following summary and bring your questions to office hours. If you need a prescription for any of these tests, please consult with your primary care provider or schedule a telemedicine consultation with one of our medical providers. **Additional fees may apply.**

**Advanced Concussion Recovery Screenings** - If you would like to determine if you have unresolved brain inflammation from a historical concussion or traumatic brain injury, we recommend you complete a mood and symptom questionnaire, balance board testing, and a QEEG "brain map" testing, as well as a number of other screenings as it relates to your symptoms. The costs associated with these tests vary based on individual need.

**Advanced Cardiovascular Testing** - If you take a STATIN medication to lower cholesterol, or if your doctor suggests you take one, then we recommend you complete a coronary artery calcium scan. A cholesterol panel offers little predictive value of your true cardiac risk. Cholesterol levels are a better predictor of metabolic syndrome, an unhealthy diet, or compromised liver health. If you want a better predictor of vascular health to help you decide if you should continue STATIN therapy, please consider the following:
- **Coronary Artery Calcium Score (CAC)** - A CAC score can help quantify your actual risk for atherosclerotic build-up in the coronary arteries. The CAC score of 0-99 is very low risk, a score of 100-299 reflects moderately increased risk, and a score of 300+ is severely increased risk.
- **D-Dimer, Leiden Factor 5, and Galectin-3 testing** - These lab tests help to identify additional inflammatory risk related to clotting disorders and heart disease.
- **Continuous Blood Pressure Monitoring** - High blood pressure is a major contributor of cognitive deficits. If you are taking blood pressure medicine and you still have episodes of high blood pressure, we recommend you do a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure reading.

**Cone Beam CT Scan (CBCT) of your mouth** - If you have a history of at least 1 root canal, history of a fractured tooth, several crowns or old dental amalgams, or if you have a complex history of dental challenges, gingivitis, periodontal disease, we encourage you to discuss cavitat screening at CBCT. This test is more sensitive than traditional plain film x-rays done at your annual dental screening. The mouth is a reservoir of very inflammatory bacteria, and if you have a hidden infection, that cavitation, or a mild abscess "silent screaming," it can negatively impact your brain health.

**Advanced Gastrointestinal Screening** - If you have irritable bowel syndrome, celiac disease, persistent acid reflux, eosinophilic esophagitis, colitis, chronic constipation or persistent diarrhea, then additional gastrointestinal screening may be indicated. More information about GI testing is needed before best testing options can be identified.

**Overnight Oximetry or a Full Sleep Study** - 25% of all individuals at risk for cognitive impairment have disordered sleep or low oxygen levels at night. Sometimes, this is an **obstructive** sleep apnea, and other times, it is a **non-obstructive central** sleep apnea. Failure to get oxygen at night impairs the glymphatic system and can negatively impact brain health. If you have sleep disturbances or you take sleeping medicine (OTC or prescription), if you snore, or if you are overweight, you are encouraged to complete an overnight sleep study.

## **Chronic Inflammation Can Lead to Inflammation in Your Brain**

Many individuals do not realize that there is a relationship to inflammation in the body and brain health. If you are in a constant of inflammation, the brain will be negatively impacted. If one of the lab tests shown below exceeds the threshold for optimal health (brain health included), a treatment intervention may be recommended. You are encouraged to take these considerations back to your primary care provider or schedule a telemedicine consultation with a provider form A Mind For All Seasons.

Your baseline **hsCRP** is 4.2. The goal is to have a very low level, at least < 1 mg/L. **hsCRP** is a general marker of an inflammatory response. Systemic inflammation can negatively impact brain health. Please review the potential causes of an elevated **hsCRP** and work to resolve triggers of systemic inflammation.

**CRP > 1:** There are many potential causes form low grade systemic inflammation. The chart below will help you identify potential contributors. You may also find insight into triggers of inflammation by reviewing our membership site.

### **Triggers of Systemic Inflammation**

| **Low Grade Infections** | **GI Tract Inflammation** | **Systemic Inflammatory** |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Chronic Sinus Infections | IBS or Leaky Gut caused by excess sugar intake, alcohol, processed foods, food preservatives and additives, frequent use of aspirin or ibuprofen (NSAIDs), acid reflux medicine or acid suppressors, constipation, diarrhea, poor digestion, etc. | Lyme disease, Shingles, Air pollution, Metabolic Syndrome / IR, Obesity, Autoimmunity, Obstructive Sleep Apnea, Sedentary Lifestyle, Smoking, Toxins |
| Urinary Tract Infection | **Acid Reflux** | **Obesity** |
| Chronic Tonsil Infections | **Irritable Bowel** | **Autoimmunity** |
| **Gingivitis** | **Bloating or Belching** | **Obstructive Sleep Apnea** |
| Poor Dental Health | **Diarrhea** | **Sedentary Lifestyle** |
| Broken Dental Fillings or Crowns | **Constipation** | **Smoking** |
| **Periodontitis** | **Diverticulitis** | **Toxins** |
| **Vaginitis** | | |
| **Cellulitis** | | |
| **Alcohol (even modest intake)** | | |
| **Processed Junk Foods** | | |

**CRP > 1**

**CRP 0.9 - omega <5:** **GI CHALLENGES** can be a common starting point for chronic inflammatory conditions. You are encouraged to have an open discussion with your health coach about supplements and dietary strategies that may help to calm systemic inflammation. Your coach can talk you through various testing options if you are concerned about GI health. **CRP 0.9 - omega <5**

**Albumin to Globulin (A/G) Ratio and Protein Synthesis**

Your baseline **A/G RATIO** is . The goal is to have a level of at least 1.5. A/G RATIO is an assessment of protein synthesis and can be a marker of liver function and nutritional status. A low A/G ratio may suggest chronic inflammation, liver dysfunction, or poor protein utilization.

**Normal A/G Ratio:** This level falls within the optimal parameters and no additional intervention is recommended.

**A/G Ratio <1.5:** There are many potential causes for a sub-optimal albumin to globulin ratio. The chart below will help you identify potential contributors. You may also find insight into factors affecting protein synthesis by reviewing our membership site.

**Uric Acid and Metabolic Inflammation**

Your baseline **URIC ACID** level was  mg/dL, and many practitioners like to see this value <6.5 mg/dL. **URIC ACID** is a systemic marker of inflammation, and when elevated, it may be contributory to high blood pressure, chronic gout, symptoms of chronic arthritis, neurodegenerative diseases, and other conditions related to systemic inflammation.

This level falls within the optimal parameters and no additional intervention is recommended.

**URIC ACID > 6.5:** There are many potential causes for elevated uric acid levels. These include dietary choices (red meat, alcohol, processed foods), reduced process foods and salt intake, avoiding high fructose corn syrup, staying well hydrated, etc. You may need personalized feedback.

You may also consider a broader discussion about the potential risks and benefits of a prescription medicine called **ALLOPURINOL**. This is a topic you are encouraged to discuss in **Office Hours** with Handy or another coach from AMFAS.

You have reported a history of **GOUT**, which is usually exacerbated by elevated **URIC ACID LEVELS**. Please visit with your memory coach and your primary care provider about your **URIC ACID LEVELS** where there is elevated risk for heart disease or neurodegenerative disease.

## **The Symptoms of a Historical Concussion May Be Chronic**

In your health history, you reported a historical head injury and many troublesome neurological symptoms. Many individuals may not think they have experienced a serious concussion because **they did not experience a loss of consciousness** associated with a head injury; however, we now understand concussion and post-concussion syndrome much better than we did 10 years ago. Some of the symptoms that you are experiencing may be related to chronic, post-concussive syndrome. One of the primary challenges associated with concussions or TBI's is that they can initiate an inflammatory response that leads to poor brain health, lower oxygen delivery to the brain, activation of the brain's immune system, a disrupted blood brain barrier, a dysfunctional pituitary gland, and a host of other metabolic challenges unique to the brain.

**TSI Masterclass** https://community.amindforallseasons.com/c/masterclass/sections/387365/lessons/1441412
- Many individuals struggle with long-term, bothersome neurological symptoms. This can include ringing in the ears (tinnitus), chronic or persistent headaches, migraines, vertigo, dizziness, anxiety, depression, chronic fatigue, etc. Each of these symptoms may be related to a condition called **DYSAUTONOMIA**, which can be linked to the afterglow of historical concussions.

**TSI Masterclass** https://community.amindforallseasons.com/c/masterclass/sections/387365/lessons/1441408
- If you would like to determine if you have unresolved brain inflammation as a historical concussion or TBI, we recommend you learn more about a **VOMS** assessment. This simple, 5-minute test helps to identify unresolved symptoms related to post-concussion syndrome.
- If you are distant from our Boise headquarters and a local consultation is not readily available, you can watch a brief video of a VOMS assessment online [?] and then administer this assessment on yourself to see if it induces troublesome symptoms. If you make your symptoms or brain fog worse, you should probably initiate an intervention to help resolve any lingering concussion recovery.
- You can find this short video on YouTube at **https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjfSkCgksL-1025**
- Please attend our Office Hours and ask about **CONCUSSION PROTOCOL** and how to incorporate more Home-based interventions into your daily routine. We can offer you several different support tools to aide in your recovery.

**High-Tech Support Options:**
- Since head injuries and the "wear and tear of life" can lead to continuous state of oxidative stress, the short-term use of a high-dose antioxidant may prove to be very helpful.
- Consider one thousand **HYPERBARIC OXYGEN CHAMBERS** at a concentrated dose of flavonoid called **LUTEOLIN**. This supplement contains a robust dose of turmeric and black pepper mixed in an MCT oil. It is very well absorbed and can help kill free-radicals that can interfere with systemic inflammation after suffering from traumatic brain injuries.
- You may consider taking an **ANTIOXIDANT CHALLENGE** using either **RIZAMAL/GLUTATHIONE 5-in-1**, **NAD+** or **FIRE ORAL MITOCHONDRIAL OPTIMIZER**. (1,500-2,500 mg per day). Each of these challenges can be embraced anywhere from 2-4 weeks.
- Each of these supplements are liquid, liposomal supplements that can help to improve absorption and efficacy.
- Each of the supplements listed are not of the highest quality and are verified by 3rd party verification, but quality and purity as an additional value for customers.
- Everyone responds to supplements in unique ways. What may be very impactful for one person may not be very impactful for another. Therefore, we have identified 3 different anti-inflammatory and antioxidant supplements that have shown to be very beneficial when taken for a brief period of time.
- Bring your questions about the **ANTIOXIDANT CHALLENGE** to Office Hours and we can provide you guidance. Regardless of the type of brain injury - minor traumatic brain injury that results in a loss of oxygen delivery to the brain. Unfortunately, this is when the brain requires the most oxygen to help recover! Because of this loss of oxygen, clients with symptoms tend to heal faster when treated with **Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT)**.
- Consider the option of using these therapies in your area or consider taking a trip to Boise, Idaho so you can experience these therapies at the **AMFAS** headquarters. We have learned that many individuals like to try these therapies before committing to the long-term treatment.
- If you are a poor sleeper, consider a trial of a prescription medication called **PROGESTERONE**. We recommend this be a bioidentical hormone, not a synthetic version of a drug. PROGESTERONE can be used in both men and women as part of our post-concussion syndrome treatments.
- **PROGESTERONE** has been used in several major, large, hospital-based clinical trials for the acute treatment of traumatic brain injuries. **PROGESTERONE** helps to calm chemical toxicity in the brain by activating GABA receptors.
- Many individuals who have experienced traumatic brain injuries may have poor sleep quality or poor duration of anxiety.
- This medicine requires a prescription. You can learn more about the use of **PROGESTERONE** by attending Office Hours.

## **Other Insights From Your Lab Work**

There may be other risk factors identified in your lab work that should be factored into your efforts to improve brain health. We have summarized these challenges below.

### **Blood Counts and Risk for Anemia**

As a part of our testing, we completed a **COMPLETE BLOOD COUNT**. Your Red Blood Cell count (**RBC**) was , your **HEMOGLOBIN** was , your **HEMATOCRIT** was , and your **PLATELET** count was .

**These markers fall within the optimal parameters and no additional intervention is recommended.**

**At least one of these variables may be suggestive that you are trending towards ANEMIA. This puts the brain at risk by limiting the delivery of oxygen to the brain.**

Your MCV condition and **MACROCYTOSIS** may be elevated. The elevated MCV level may be related to the use of **ALCOHOL**, or it may indicate you have stomach-related challenges like acid reflux. However, it may also be related to other factors and conditions or your healthcare providers would be happy to talk to that. Please consider additional interventions. Please schedule a telemedicine consultation if you want more support. Otherwise, you can address this with your primary care physician.

### **Risk for Blood Clots and Cerebral Vascular Disease**

We checked a **D-DIMER** level which was elevated at  ng/L. The **D-DIMER** has more top-of-mind awareness since the COVID pandemic. If you are at risk for neurodegenerative disorder from vascular risk factors (heart disease, stroke, blood clots) and you are not currently taking an anticoagulant like **ELIQUIS** or **XARELTO** (and many others) you may consider starting a few OTC supplements to lower your risk of blood clots.

You are encouraged to start a supplement called **NITRIC BALANCE**. The standard dose is 1-2 tsp 2x's daily. This supplement is a rapid acting liposomal preparation that contains **VINPOCETINE** and other nutrients that support vasodilation of your blood vessels and improved circulation and blood flow.

You are encouraged to start a supplement called **NEURO2**. The standard dose is 1 capsule 2x's daily. This supplement is a capsule that contains **VINPOCETINE** and other nutrients that support vasodilation and blood flow.

If you have had a historical blood clot, or you are at high risk for vascular issues, you may consider checking your **FACTOR V LEIDEN** genetics.

Your **PLATELET** count is suboptimal and **is not obvious contributor** listed in your history. If you are taking any medications (**NSAIDS**, acid reducers, seizure medications, etc.), these can contribute to a low-trending **PLATELET** count. Consider the **ORTHO ARTA** as part of treatment approach or to discuss about alternatives to immunity and others anti-platelet therapies.

Your White Blood cell count **WBC** was , your **ABSOLUTE NEUTROPHIL** count was , and your **ABSOLUTE LYMPHOCYTE** count was . These cell counts represent a generalized reflection of your immune response at the time of your lab tests.

**These markers fall within the optimal parameters and no additional intervention is recommended.**

**At least one of these values is ELEVATED and may reflect an active immune response. We encourage you to consult with your primary care provider about these values.**

**At least one of these values is LOWER than expected and may be suspicious for a weakened immune response. This may be a one-time result in your results, or it may be a pattern which shows up consistently.**

More information is needed. When **WBC** counts are persistently low, it may suggest a weakened immune response to common viruses or bacteria. I would be happy to offer some potential interventions, especially if you are one that get sick contacts. Please schedule a consultation if you want more insights. Otherwise, you can address this with your primary care provider.

At least one of these values may reflect an active immune response and more testing is recommended.

When **WBC** and **ABSOLUTE LYMPHOCYTES** are elevated, it is suggestive of an underlying viral infection. Given your history () and activities, it is definitely more likely blood that requires attention.

At least one of these values is **LOWER** than expected and may be suspicious for a weakened immune response. We encourage you to consult with your primary care provider about these values.

Consider a **T & B LYMPHOCYTE DIFFERENTIAL** and a **QUANTITATIVE IMMUNOGLOBULINS (A/E/G/M) PANEL** to evaluate the health of your immune system and to evaluate the risk for immunodeficiency.

This is considered specialty testing and is not included in The Enhance ProtocolÂ® panel of labs.

You may be a candidate for additional immune strengthening interventions such as **N-ACETYLCYSTEINE**, **BIOFILM DISRUPT**, and **CAT'S CLAW ELITE**. You may want to incorporate valuable information about viral infections and ways to strengthen immune system when immune exhaustion may be an issue. **Please join Office Hours and bring up this topic with our medical director, Randy Vawdrey.**

After you complete that testing, you may benefit from a 3-6 month trial of daily **VALACYCLOVIR** 1 gram/day. This is a prescription medication that may be helpful to your local pharmacy if you choose a trial.

Your baseline **ELECTROLYTE** levels were as follows: **SODIUM** was , **POTASSIUM** was , **CHLORIDE** was , **CALCIUM** was . If any of these values fall outside of the optimal parameters, follow up is essential. There are many potential reasons for this to occur (dehydration, medications, protein levels, kidney function, etc.). We encourage you to review these values with your primary care provider.

**These markers fall within the optimal parameters and no additional intervention is recommended.**

At least one of these values falls outside of the optimal values. There may be many potential reasons for this to occur (dehydration or fluid status, supplementation, medications, protein levels, kidney function, etc.). We encourage you to review these values with your primary care provider.

An **eGFR** of  and a **SERUM CREATININE** of  are markers of kidney function. These markers fall within the optimal parameters and no additional intervention is recommended.

Your **eGFR** of  and/or **SERUM CREATININE** is not troublesome, and no specific recommendation is offered. However, we always recommend a very intentional effort to stay well hydrated and to be cautious of anti-inflammatory medications such as **NSAIDs** (**IBUPROFEN**, **NAPROXEN**, **ALEVE**, **MELOXICAM** and **CELEBREX**) because they can damage the kidneys.

Your markers of kidney function are trending towards some concern. Where possible, you should avoid anti-inflammatory medications, and you should take an intentional approach to adequate hydration as other factors that impacts kidney health. Please share your lab results with your family physician.

Your markers of kidney function are trending towards some concern. Where possible, you should avoid anti-inflammatory medications such as **NSAIDs** (**IBUPROFEN**, **NAPROXEN**, **ALEVE**, **MELOXICAM** and **CELEBREX**). Keep an eye on blood pressure and consider adequate hydration as other factors that impacts kidney health. Please share your lab results with your family physician.

Your metabolic panel revealed a **LIVER FUNCTION TEST (LFT's)** results. **LFT's** can be a sign of inflammation in the liver or gall bladder. Your baseline **ALT** value is  and your baseline **ALK-Phos** was , and your baseline **AST** level was . These **LFT's** may be indicative of a challenge in the liver or gall bladder. When any one of these values is starting to trend elevated, follow-up with your primary care provider to identify 'why' your liver enzymes are trending.

**These markers fall within the optimal parameters and no additional intervention is recommended.**

There are many potential causes for elevations in **LIVER FUNCTION TESTS (LFT's)**. Some of the most common reasons include: **Antibiotics**, **Acetaminophen (Tylenol)**, **Alcohol** and when **LFT's** are elevated, there is a reason to dig deeper. The liver is the organ that metabolizes medications, toxins, chemicals, and simple toxins in the body. So essential to good neurological health, alcohol a challenge to liver that needs addressed. Sometimes this is as simple as a change in the liver, and head to the liver can mean even in you only drink modestly, you may consider discontinuing **ALCOHOL** to protect the liver. We encourage you to open a discussion with your primary care doctor to investigate.

Since at least one of these values is trending elevated, we have already recommended **NAC** and/or **LIPOSOMAL GLUTATHIONE** support. The rationale used for testing on behalf is a positive impact has been made after starting The Enhance ProtocolÂ®.

We calculated a **FIBROSIS** score related to liver function tests and alcohol use. Your **FIB-4** score is  and cirrhosis is typically predicted at a score of > 1.5. Though your **LFT's** fall within the optimal parameters, you are showing a **MACROCYTOSIS** as identified above.

## **Body Weight Can Be A Predictor of Brain Health**

Total body weight can be a sensitive topic, and we want to approach it respectfully. If you are underweight, you are at risk for certain conditions that negatively impact brain health. The same goes for being overweight. We recognize that BMI is simply one way to measure total body weight, but it does not adequately reflect the true percentages of your muscle mass or fat mass. Understanding the difference between muscle mass and fat mass can help you make decisions to optimize your health.

If you need additional support, please schedule a time to visit with one of our medical providers.

### **Body Weight Often Correlates with Brain Health**

| **BODY MASS INDEX (BMI)** is a calculated measure of body fat based on height and weight. Excess body weight can be a symptom of a metabolic disorder. **BMI** often correlates with diabetic challenges and brain health. Your baseline **BMI** is  kg/mÂ². There are many **BMI** online calculators within the health industry category of **BMI** > 25 as optimal, there are many variables that can impact the interpretation of **BMI**. One of the most common occurs in those with a high percentage of lean body mass. Work with your health coach to determine if you need to focus on optimizing your **BMI**. |
|---|

As you participate in coaching, work with your memory coach to identify how you could implement a **KETOGENIC** diet to see if it helps to improve cognition. Consider applying the benefits of intermittent fasting and intentionality with healthy fats into your diet.

Weight loss that occurs along with very intentional meal planning often correlates with improved cognitive function.

Since your **BMI** is > 25, you are encouraged to screen your oxygen saturation levels at night using an **OVERNIGHT OXIMETRY** test. Some folks who also snore may choose to complete a full **SLEEP STUDY** to rule out **OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA**. Low oxygen levels at night add to the risk for brain damage, and this is especially harmful in those who already struggle with brain fog or cognitive impairment.

## **Other Insights From Your Past Medical History**

There may be several other risk factors identified in your medical history that should factor into your efforts to improve brain health. We have summarized these challenges below. We mention these issues because your first reported them. When you completed the questionnaire of your medical history, we identified a potential relationship to your physical health and your brain health that you may not have recognized.

We created a risk profile (shown below) that shows how elements from your personal health history can have an impact on your brain health. This is a proprietary risk profile that we created at A Mind For All Season to support our decision making about the next steps. The risk profile comes from your health history questionnaire and your laboratory test results.

---

### **RISK PROFILE I**

Your **Risk Profile** is a visual summary of your risk factors for cognitive decline. The information for this graph comes from two sets of data:

Your **Health History Questionnaire** completed when you started The Enhance ProtocolÂ® and your **Laboratory Tests Results**.

This risk profile helps us to prioritize interventions so you can optimize physical and cognitive health.

**Risk Factor Analysis:**
- **Traumatic:** % ()
- **Vascular:** % ()
- **Toxic:** % ()
- **Glycotoxic:** % ()
- **Atrophic:** % ()
- **Inflammation:** % ()

### **TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY (TBI) or repeat CONCUSSIONS can lead to impaired brain function**

You have an increased risk of **TRAUMA** to your brain from .

After a head injury or concussion, many individuals develop persistent neurological symptoms. This is called **"PCS"** or **Persistent Concussion Syndrome**. These symptoms from historical head injuries (even very old injuries) can develop slowly over time. The most common challenges include mood disorders, hormone deficiencies, irritable bowel symptoms, frequent headaches/migraines, unprovoked anxiety, sleep disorders, and cognitive impairment. Please consider embracing key interventions to help calm brain inflammation.
- Review the section in our membership program on **DYSAUTONOMIA**
- Complete an **OMEGA-3 CHALLENGE** as taught by Michael Lewis, MD. This can be especially helpful if your **OMEGA-3** levels are suboptimal
- Embrace regular cardiovascular exercise, particularly **High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)**
- Consider a trial of **Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT)** - More information below at the conclusion of this Roadmap Report *

### **VASCULAR RISK - Unhealthy blood flow to the brain can lead to â'd brain health and neurological dysfunction**

Vascular risk considers triggers that disrupt or compromise blood flow through blood vessels and oxygen delivery to the brain. Your vascular-related risks include: .

The intention is to improve cardiovascular health and the health of your blood vessels (arteries) are to:
- Regular and consistent exercise, deep breathing, reduce your risk for sleep apnea, and to calm inflammatory disorders.

In individuals with obvious risk factors, there are certain supplements (nitric oxide support) and interventions (hyperbaric oxygen, pulsed electromagnetic frequency therapy, and red and NIR light therapy).

### **RISK OF TOXICITY - Heavy Metals, Chemicals, Biotoxins may negatively impact brain health**

Risk factors or insights that suggest you may be at risk for **TOXICITY** include: .

The challenges noted in this section suggest there is a good reason to expand your lab work to include **TOXICITY** testing. The purpose of toxicity testing is to identify what toxins your immune system is battling.

**Please consult with one of our coaches during Office Hours for more details about the testing and pricing options to evaluate the impact of TOXICITY on you.**

### **GLYCOTOXIC RISK - â'd Blood Sugar, Insulin Resistance, or Diabetes may negatively impact brain health**

When **BLOOD SUGAR** levels run high, or when you show certain signs of **METABOLIC CHALLENGES**, you are more likely to damage sensitive blood vessels and nerves. Symptoms of poor metabolic health include chronic fatigue, neuropathy, loss of sensation or sensitivity, and brain fog or memory problems. Elements in your health history suggest that you may have metabolic challenges, including: .

**Please consult with one of our coaches during Office Hours for more details about specific intentional **DIETARY INTERVENTIONS** that may improve your metabolic and brain health.**

### **INSUFFICIENCY SYNDROMES such as suboptimal levels of nutrients, minerals, and hormones can impact brain health**

When the body has **INSUFFICIENT** levels of nutrients or hormones, the function(s) of the central nervous system (CNS) is negatively impacted and can lead to **ATROPHY** of the brain and nerves. The most common form of **INSUFFICIENCY SYNDROME** in women is menopause! Your potential risk factors include: .

The brain requires an adequate or 'sufficient' amount of vitamins, nutrients, hormones, and antioxidants to function optimally. When any of these building blocks are at inadequate levels in the body, your brain may suffer from a form of **'insufficiency syndrome.'**

**Low VITAMIN levels may suggest suboptimal dietary intake or inadequate digestion and absorption of nutrients.**

**Bowel health plays a critical role in how you digest and absorb nutrients essential for brain health.**

**Several SUPPLEMENT and anti-inflammation strategies will be recommended through the Roadmap**.*

### **Systemic INFLAMMATION can lead to neurological impairment and negatively impact brain health**

Your systemic **INFLAMMATORY** risk factors may include: .

**LIFESTYLE INTERVENTIONS** have become the primary approach to calming chronic and persistent inflammation.

At the conclusion of your Roadmap, you will learn more about the type of lifestyle interventions that help to promote optimal brain health.

**Based on your risk profile, we recommend prioritizing:**

1. **Address ** (% of total risk)
2. **Monitor ** (% of total risk)
3. **Consider ** (% of total risk)

Work with your health coach to develop a targeted intervention plan focusing on your highest risk areas.

### **Autoimmune Disease and Brain Health**

As a result of your health history, we have summarized some principles of functional medicine that may benefit you. These considerations come from our medical director's history of managing complex medical challenges in a busy family practice. His experience using non-traditional interventions has helped many clients find relief from chronic and complex medical challenges.

Did you know that more than â of the cells in the brain are directly connected of your immune system? That's right... only â of the cells in the brain function as neurons, and the other cells are directly tied to your immune system including microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. That is why any inflammatory challenge (chronic or repeat infection, gut issues, toxins, and the GI tract) and chronic GI challenges, can be one of the more significant reasons you struggle with cognitive challenges.

You may consider purchasing the book called **The TIGER ProtocolÂ®**. This book details an integrative autoimmune disease approach beyond immunosuppression medicine. **TIGER** is a mnemonic that helps individuals remember the following triggers of immune system dysfunction:
- **Toxins** activate immune surveillance and can lead to immune and tissues dysfunction. Toxins need to be identified and cleared through lifestyle and intervention. When toxins are stored or bound to connective tissue, the immune system can become activated against that tissue and lead to autoimmune disease(s). You may benefit from additional **TOXIN** testing.
- **Infections** can trigger the immune system in both acute and chronic settings. The early signs of COVID-19 were the loss of the sense of taste and smell. Did you realize that this is a symptom of neurological dysfunction? It is important to both identify and eliminate these infections through anti-infective or sub-antimicrobial interventions. Hidden infections (like infections from historical root canals or broken or decayed crowns and fillings, are a common place for infections to stimulate inflammation) and/or brain and neurological function.
- **Gut health** is foundational to an integrative approach to autoimmunity. Immune specialists suggest that as much as 70% of your total immune function is based in the **Gut Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT)**. When you eat is satiety! The food choices that we make, and the Eating plans we embrace, can trigger food sensitivity, allergies, and autoimmunity through poor gut permeability.
- **Eating plans** are an essential treatment in all autoimmune disease states. The only thing you should not when you eat is satiety! The food choices that we make, and the Eating plans we embrace, can trigger food sensitivity, allergies, and autoimmunity through poor gut permeability.
- **Rest** is essential to calm the autonomic nervous system and stress is an activator of our fight or flight response.
- **Adequate and restful sleep** are anti-health and metabolism, and nutrition and neuroprotective strategies). However, individuals with autoimmune disease more more likely to experience flare-ups of autoimmunity when the endure emotional stress. Establishing an active plan to calm the body and reduce stress can improve overall health.

**Conventional approaches** to autoimmunity often jump to pharmaceutical (namely immunosuppressants). However, there are several additional lab tests (Cyrex lab panels), off-label pharmaceutical treatment options (low dose naltrexone) and nutritional supplementation (**RESVERATROL**, **EGCG** and **SUPPLEMENTAL VITAMIN D**) that can help reduce symptoms of autoimmunity. Please attend Office Hours or schedule a telemedicine consultation with a provider from **AMFAS** to learn more about expanding your support and optimizing your quality of life.

### **Chronic Migraine Headaches**

Though the term "vascular headache" is outdated, migraines involve changes in the blood vessels of the brain. Though the contributors of migraine headaches involve complex neurological changes, chemical signaling, and neurotransmitter release, the brain's blood flow and the way the blood vessel system regulates the blood flow often plays a major role in the development, frequency and intensity of migraine headaches.

Migraine headaches often include other neurological systems in addition to headaches. These symptoms can include nausea, flashes of light, speech and language disruption, etc. Because many of these same challenges are seen in patients with progressive concussion symptoms, please refer to the section on concussion for strategies to prevent and minimize migraine headaches.

How would you rate your chronic headaches? Many individuals who struggle with chronic headaches also have poor cervical spine health, chronic neck tension, sore neck muscles, and poor range of motion. You can learn more about this topic by watching this webinar here: https://community.amindforallseasons.com/c/masterclass/sections/551654/lessons/2090228

Exercise is one of the most beneficial activities to prevent migraine headaches. Exercise stimulates the blood vessels to dilate and contract in response to changes in blood flow. The blood vessels also respond to changes in the POâ (or DPOâ) in the blood vessels if you need a regular and consistent exercise program.

**High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)** is a popular workout technique where you alternate between short bursts of intense exercise and brief recovery periods. Think of it like this: you go all out for a short time, then take it easy for a bit, and then repeat. This type of training can be very effective in just 20-30 minutes and is stimulating to your heart and circulatory system.

If you suffer from chronic migraine headache, you are encouraged to learn more about the **Buffalo Concussion Treadmill Test (BCTT)**. The **BCTT** lessons are a symptom-limited exercise protocol designed to help identify neurological and vascular thresholds that predict conditions when you are more at risk of a migraine headache.

If you struggle to exercise, consider exercise with oxygen therapy. This type of therapy supports exercise while breathing enriched oxygen delivery to the brain. Work with your coach or seek a local provider to find exercise performance improvement or increasing oxygen delivery to tissues during or after muscle recovery. Others report improved cognitive function by increasing oxygen deliver to the brain.

**Chronic headaches may also be related to "leaky gut".** Those who suffer from migraine headaches have often used routine NSAIDs (Ibuprofen) that may negatively impact GI health and lead to rebound headaches. Consider additional lab tests such as **CYREX 2 & 20** testing to evaluate barrier health as it potentially relates to your chronic headaches.

There may be several supplements that can help prevent or minimize the frequency and intensity of your migraine headaches. Look to these supplements and consider them:

**Consider a trial of a supplement called **NITRIC BALANCE**, a blend of nitrates/nitrites. This supplement boasts a proprietary blend of nitrocompounds that stimulate the production of nitric oxide and improve blood flow. Consider a trial of **BEET ROOT and CITRULLINE**. This supplement is a blend of beet root powder, hawthorn berry and citrulline. This blend also acts to stimulate the production of nitric oxide and improve blood flow.

**If you have tried these options and you continue to struggle with headaches or migraines, please bring your questions to Office Hours and ask about potential triggers of migraine headaches (hormone imbalance, food allergies, sleep apnea, other).**

---

### **Parkinson's Disease**

Please refer to the section on **PARKINSON'S DISEASE** and consider the integrative therapy options. Many practitioners view **PARKINSON'S DISEASE** as a combination of genetic susceptibility + damage from toxins. Please collaborate with your primary care provider and your memory coach to identify the potential benefit of **TOXICITY TESTING**.
- Are you aware of the research about exercise and Parkinson's disease? Exercise is one of the most substantial interventions to delay the progression of Parkinson's. Where possible, you are encouraged to find ways to get higher intensity exercise. One way to do that would be to come and experience exercise with oxygen (**EWOT**) at the **AMFAS** headquarters. Similar to a **CPAP** machine used in obstructive sleep apnea, we connect you to an oxygen mask and work you out on a stationary or recumbent bike. It is such an easy way to maximize your exercise and oxygen levels, and it can help reduce any intolerance or soreness you experience with exercise.
- Though purely anecdotal, you may consider a **VITAMIN B1 (THIAMINE) CHALLENGE**. There is a growing body of naturopathic medical individual with has reported starting small groups studies using high-dose **THIAMINE** for the management of Parkinson's Disease. The intervention appears to be very safe and there is a very low risk of an adverse reaction. The positive outcomes seem to be more related to the non-motor symptoms of **PD**. If you want to participate, you will need orders for intramuscular **THIAMINE** injections. This will require ongoing **TELEMEDICINE** consultations, or you will need to coordinate this effort with your local **PCP**. The initial dose is 100 mg, administered 2-3/week. You can read more about this protocol at **www.highdosethiamine.org**
- In the section about oxidative stress, we encouraged you to consider a **GLUTATHIONE CHALLENGE**. Please watch the following video on YouTube **https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_aDCxry3Bo** and come to Office Hours to learn how to embrace an oral **GLUTATHIONE CHALLENGE**.
- Please do not underestimate the impact of dental health on Parkinson's Disease. We have had clients who have completed a **CONE BEAM CT SCAN** of their historical root canals only to find occult cavitations and abscesses. And when these infections are resolved, they noted a significant improvement in the motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's Disease.
- A quick note about diet and Parkinson's Disease. Dietary proteins (meat) can interfere with **SINEMET**. It is not that many patients did not know how impactful this interference can be. If you use **SINEMET** in the morning and afternoons, you may choose to have your proteins later in the day so that you maximize the impact of **SINEMET**. Please come to office hours for more information.

### **GI Health & the Gut-Brain Connection**

Please refer to the section on GI health, IBS, and leaky gut. Many practitioners view GI disorders as a definable and treatable challenge. We can improve your brain. Consider the options for additional testing and integrative medicine options. You may benefit from a telemedicine consultation to work through challenges like persistent acid reflux and irritable bowel syndrome.

To better understand the relationship between your **GUT HEALTH** and your **BRAIN HEALTH**, watch the masterclass.

ð **Masterclass** https://community.amindforallseasons.com/c/masterclass/sections/387368/lessons/1471028

There are several extremely helpful interventions that may help support healthy gut function, but it requires a problem-specific focus. We like to call this a 'north-to-south' perspective when working to improve common GI challenges. As an introduction to this perspective, please consider the following options:

**MICROBIOME DIVERSITY** is essential for GI health. If you have GI symptoms (acid reflux, gassy, bloating, diarrhea, constipation, or IBS, you should strive to improve your microbiome health. This may be especially helpful if you have **multiple food sensitivities or allergies**.

ð **Masterclass** https://community.amindforallseasons.com/c/masterclass/sections/387368/lessons/1498218

If you continue to struggle with persistent GI issues, you are encouraged to book a **TELEMEDICINE** consultation. **Additional fees may apply.** This recommendation is offered because of some of the concerns you identified in your health history. Additional interventions that you could consider include:
- Consider adding **ULTRA D 5000** to strengthen the dendritic cells of the Gut Associated Lymphatic Tissues (GALT). The recommended dose of this supplement is 1 tsp/day. If you choose to use this supplement, please discontinue using other **VITAMIN D** supplements. This may be especially helpful if you have chronic sinus congestion or chronic bronchitis.
- Consider a trial of **BETAINE HCL** and **DIGESTIVE ENZYMES** with each meal to help support digestive health. This may be especially helpful if you have been taking acid-reducing medications.
- Consider starting a trial of **SWEDISH BITTERS** as a means of promoting GI motility and to optimize release of bile from the liver. This may be especially helpful if you have a history of gall bladder problems.
- Consider the use of **KETO vs. CARNIVORE vs. STOOL testing vs. FOOD ALLERGIES** to rule out identifiable pathology. This may be especially helpful if you tried several supplements with limited benefits.
- Consider using **EnteroviTe** 2 caps/day and/or probiotic supplements for healthy gut function. This may be helpful if you have already completed "prep studies" and you had a low butyrate level or other short chain fatty acids.

At first glance, it seems you have learned about different eating styles (**KETO vs. CARNIVORE**) that can help calm symptoms of an irritable bowel. A short-term adoption of one of these eating styles may prove:

**Paulllia**, **SeaC of GI**

**Surg-Wst-Loss** - You have noted surgical weight loss intervention in your personal history. Surgical weight loss interventions often lead to IBS, dumping syndrome, diarrhea, and/or other challenges with your bowels. This variable will necessitate an ongoing focus on GI health and under these circumstances, **GI interventions**.

---

### **Chronic Constipation**

Healthy bowel movements are an essential part of GI Health and Detox. Refer to the section on **Constipation**. Consider the following options to ease the challenges of constipation.

**Safe considerations:** Review the section in your Guidebook about the challenges of **CHRONIC CONSTIPATION** and look for additional interventions you could employ to optimize your bowel health.
- **Improve your daily hydration** by drinking Â½ your body weight in ounces. If you continue with constipation, consider a few additional interventions as outlined below:
- Consider using a supplement like **MAGNESIUM GLYCINATE**. This supplement does not taste good, but it will help stimulate muscle production and regular bowel movements. Much of the Standard American Diet (SAD) diet has moved away from bitter herbs and foods. Bitters can help to reduce feelings of nausea, relieve occasional indigestion, ease heartburn, support balanced blood sugar levels, support your liver, and improve the overall function of the bowel. This is a good first step to improve your bowel patterns.
- Consider taking a bile salt like **OX BILE 250-500 mg 2x/day** to support bile flow and to help improve constipation. This is a good first step to see if you can improve bowel patterns.
- Consider adding **COCONUT OIL** or **MCT OIL** to your daily routine. If you are still struggling with constipation, **COCONUT OIL** is a natural laxative. It also is loaded with **MCT OIL** can help people struggling to optimize brain health.
- Since **CONSTIPATION** may result from an impaired **VAGUS NERVE**, you could consider **GARGLING** 4-5 times a morning and night to stimulate the **VAGUS NERVE**. You may also consider brushing your teeth to stimulate the **GAG REFLEX**. When the **VAGUS** nerve is stimulated, the bowels often have improved innervation and constipation can be alleviated. More information can be found in the section on **CONSTIPATION**. When you attend Office Hours, we will learn more about simple lifestyle 'hacks' to try and improve bowel function.

---

### **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) and Cognitive Decline**

The herpes virus family can increase your risk of cognitive decline. Refer to the section on Herpes infections and consider ways you can lower the risk of repeat infections.

If you have frequent viral outbreaks, you are more likely to also experience symptoms consistent with **CHRONIC VIRAL ENCEPHALITIS** (headaches, vision changes, light and sound sensitivity, motion sickness and ringing in the ears). Repeated breakouts of cold sores (repeat **HSV1** infections) are now considered a major contributory factor for Alzheimer's disease.

Depending on the frequency of your cold sores, you may be a candidate for daily suppressive therapy using a prescription medication called **VALACYCLOVIR**. The standard dose is 1000 mg/day. **Additional fees may apply.** The Q&A opportunities during Office Hours can be an essential resource to help you work through your potential to benefit from prescription medications.

There is an OTC supplement called **LYSINE** that can also help to prevent repeat cold sores. The standard daily dose is 1000 mg/day. If you prefer a natural prevention strategy for **HSV** outbreaks, this is a good place to start.
- Consider intermittent use of a supplement that contains **TRANSFER FACTORS**. The best time to use this supplement is during an active outbreak. Transfer factors are derived from colostrum, and they serve to activate natural killer cells within the immune system. They are recommended for those with a history of active, intermittent, or chronic viral infections. A brand that is often recommended in the functional medicine world is **4Life TRANSFER FACTOR**. The standard dose is two capsules/day. Another brand is called **WELLNESS TRANSFER FACTOR**, and their standard dose is one capsule 2x's/day. You can purchase this supplement online.

---

### **Chronic Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) and â Risk of Cognitive Impairment**

**Epstein Barr Virus (EBV)** can set up an underlying inflammatory disorder that leads to fatigue and cognitive disorders. Please refer to the section on **EBV** and consider the use of the supplements to alleviate symptoms.

Physical manifestations of chronic **EBV** may include intermittent rashes, intermittent low-grade fevers, intermittent earaches, chronic allergic rhinitis, intermittent sore throat, chronically swollen tonsils, palpable lymph nodes around the ear, the neck, the collarbone and the armpits, and intermittent congestion. If you resonate with a number of these symptoms, then you may be a candidate for additional testing.

Chronic **EBV** infections can be tricky! If you have **EBV REACTIVATION SYNDROME**, or chronic immune suppression, you may benefit from additional testing, including:

â **T and B LYMPHOCYTE DIFFERENTIAL** (LabCorp testing # 006317)
â **QUANTITATIVE IMMUNOGLOBULINS A/E/G/M** (LabCorp testing # 004229S)

**EBV VCA IgM, EBV VCA IgG, EBV EA IgG, and EBNA IgG**

If you are experiencing a risk for activation of **CHRONIC VIRAL ENCEPHALITIS** (headaches, vision changes, light and sound sensitivity, motion sickness and ringing in the ears, etc.). If you resonate with these symptoms, you may be a candidate for routine suppressive therapy such as **VALACYCLOVIR**.

Speak with your primary care provider about completing some additional testing and about potential use of **VALACYCLOVIR 500 - 1000 mg per day** to help suppress viral replication. If you choose not to start a prescription medicine, consider a **LYSINE 1000 mg/day** as a natural prevention strategy.

If your **PCP** is not comfortable with these tests or interventions, you may benefit from a **TELEMEDICINE** consultation to talk through these challenges and not coordinate the discussion about optimizing your treatment approach.

If you are experiencing a **VIRAL FLAIR**, there are a host of natural interventions that help to support immune activation against chronic viral infections. They may include:

â **TRANSFER FACTORS (4Life TRANSFER FACTOR** or **WELLNESS TRANSFER FACTOR**). Transfer factors are derived from bovine colostrum, and like the passive immunity an infant receives from a nursing mother, exogenous colostrum may help to activate natural killer cells within our immune system.

â **X-VIROMIN** supports immune function with nutraceutical agents such as astragalus & licorice root.

â **BIOFILM CLR** is an enzymatic agent that helps break down biofilm and quench free radicals.

â **CAT'S CLAW ELITE (UNCARIA TOMENTOSA + MONOLAUREN)** by QuickSilver Scientific. This supplement contains botanicals that may strengthen your immune response to viral infections and could help boost your immune function for 2-4 months until your symptoms improve.

These interventions are not used indefinitely! They are interventions that are analogous to antibiotic that would be used to calm an acute infection. Most of these interventions are employed for 1-3 months depending on the clinical situation. Consider bringing this question to Randy's Office Hours, or for a personal discussion, schedule a **TELEMEDICINE** consultation.

### **Toxicity is Real & May Impact Your Brain Health**

Toxic exposures can be a significant contributor of brain fog and neurodegenerative diseases. Once you have solved nutritional deficiencies and hormone imbalances, you need to check for toxicity. Toxic substances in our immediate environment can enter our bodies, make their way to our brains, and negatively impact cognitive health.

Our medical director prepared a masterclass series using laboratory examples from our current clients. You are encouraged to watch this series of 3 webinars completed in August 2024. You can access the first of these webinars with this link.

ð **Masterclass** https://community.amindforallseasons.com/c/masterclass/sections/387364/lessons/1441403

There are many laboratory tests that can help you identify your risk for toxicity with **DEMENTOGENS** (chemicals that lead to dementia. Please review the following highlighted recommendations to better understand your risk for toxicity.

Have you ever completed any testing for **TOXICITY?** Many individuals talk about **DETOX** programs, but they have never completed a good **TOXICITY SCREENING**.

I invite you to watch this 20-minute webinar called the **Utah Meth Cop Project**. It was produced by a legal firm and co-sponsored by the Attorney General from the State of Utah. It is insightful and offers some thoughts on the risk for the accumulation of toxins in the average person. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5qAJZ-Shs8

There are several reasonably priced tests for **TOXICITY** on the market. These are a few of our favorites:

**Doctor's Data:** is a test called the **MERCURY TRITEST** and **BLOOD METALS PANEL** which screens for imbalanced nutrients and toxic metals. The test utilizes blood, hair, and urine to measure both exposure and excretion rate. Learn more at https://www.quicksilverscientific.com/products/mercury-tri-test-blood-metals-panel/

**Great Plains:** pos=4&_fid=134a90277&_ss=c

**Mosaic Diagnostics:** a **TRYPTOPHAN** test that tests for chemical classes including phthalates, VOCs, pesticides, and other important toxicants that can negatively impact your health. You can learn more about these tests at https://live-mosaic-opt.pantheonsite.io/resources/

**Cyrex Labs:** offers immune response arrays that evaluate your immune response to foods, chemicals, metals, and environmental toxins. You can learn more about these tests at www.joecyrex.com

There are several tests that may help identify your risk for **TOXICITY**. **Please plan to attend Office Hours to discuss how and when you can address your personal risk.**

**Quick-GDX** - In your personal health history, you reported a history of challenges with your gall bladder (either gall stones or gall bladder removal). This often occurs when the bile flow is compromised or impaired, and it suggests you have an additional risk factor for **TOXICITY**. If the flow of the bile slows, it becomes sluggish, and this becomes yet another reason to consider additional toxin testing.

### **Lifestyle Change is a Powerful Way to Improve Brain Health**

Many individuals are looking for the "secret sauce" that will help them to improve their brain health. We have learned that very intentional and significant changes in lifestyle will go a long way to improve blood flow to your brain, enhance oxygen delivery, lower inflammation, and reduce oxidative stress. When lifestyles improve, all other interventions discussed in this Enhance Roadmapâ¢ are amplified!

**Lifestyle Interventions and brain health. There is power behind B-E-D-D-S-S-S!**

We invite you to be intentional and incorporate as many of the lifestyle interventions listed below into your daily routine as possible. There is power in the completion of each of the following: **Brain Training, Exercise, Dietary Interventions, Dental Health and Hygiene, Sleep Optimization, Stress Management and Supplements**.

To learn how to establish healthy habits that break through health barriers of reshaping your lifestyle, please watch this masterclass on establishing brain healthy habits to help you find longer term success.

Please review the sections below regarding **THERAPEUTIC LIFESTYLES** that promote mental clarity. Each of these recommendations can strengthen brain health and optimize your cognition.
- Review your **CNS VS** test results and consider your interest or potential for benefit with a subscription to **BRAIN HQ**. The brain is very plastic, and it can respond to specific challenges that have been incorporated into this app. Ask your coach for more information. To learn about a home-based brain entrainment device like a **DAVID Delight Pro**, please watch this masterclass illustrating how you can do some brain therapy in the comfort of your own home.

- You can learn more about brain training programs like **BRAIN HQ** by attending office hours.
- **EXERCISE** is one of the most researched interventions known to improve brain function and is an essential stimulus for neurogenesis and synaptogenesis. A daily exercise routine can improve cerebral blood flow, enhance oxygen delivery to the brain, and stimulate hormones that improve brain function. Many participants find that **LiveO2â¢** is a fantastic way to enhance total body oxygen levels during exercise. Ask your memory coach if you are a candidate for **LiveO2â¢** therapy.
- **EXERCISE** is one of the most beneficial strategies for increasing **CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW**. Depending on your physical health, would you consider increasing your current level of physical activity? Work with your coach identify how you can initiate a program that correlates with your physical health. Participants with obstructive sleep apnea, or a history of head injury and blood pressure challenges may find added support and benefit with routine **LiveO2â¢** training. When you support cardiovascular exercise with oxygen support, you can experience a powerful impact in your exercise, especially the recovery phase after exercise. Something special happens when you exercise with extra oxygen support!
- You may consider a trip to the **AMFAS HQ** in Boise Idaho where you can experience **EXERCISE WITH OXYGEN THERAPY (EWOT)** and many other therapeutic interventions to improve brain health. Ask one of our coaches for more information during Office Hours.
- Do not underestimate the power of **DIET** to improve brain health. Your coach can help you to apply the principles explained in the dietary section of your Guidebook.
- Have you ever heard of a **CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITOR (CGM)**? It is common to see an individual with diabetes wearing a blood sugar sensor on the arm. Wearing a **CGM** is one of the best ways to evaluate the impact of your diet on your metabolic health. Inquire with your coach for instructions on how to obtain and apply a **CGM**. We recommend that every participant of The Enhance Protocolâ¢ (including all non-diabetics) wear a **CGM** to learn about how their diet impacts their metabolic health. Come to Office Hours and ask how you can get a **CGM** to conduct a personal metabolic analysis.
- There is a growing body of research linking brain health to your **DENTAL HEALTH**. Decide today to make positive changes to improve your dental health. Start using an ultrasonic toothbrush, consider purchasing a water pick, and visit a dentist if you are long overdue.
- To learn more about how your dental health impacts your brain health, please watch the following masterclass.

ð **Masterclass** https://community.amindforallseasons.com/c/masterclass/sections/387366/lessons/1441417
- If you have a history of at least **1 ROOT CANAL**, you are encouraged to attend Office Hours and inquire about the benefits of a **CONE BEAM CT SCAN (CBCT)** of your mouth. When the nerve to a particular tooth is removed, bacteria can infiltrate the root area and initiate a sub-acute inflammatory response that is transmitted to the brain. In many instances, traditional dental x-rays are not sensitive enough to pick up these kinds of challenges and **CT** scanning is helpful.
- Though most folks understand how valuable sleep is for good mental and cognitive health, **25%** of individuals with cognitive dysfunction have disordered sleep. As such, every person with cognitive decline should be screened for sleep apnea. Suboptimal nighttime oxygen levels amplify inflammation and impair cerebral blood flow and impair the brain's lymphatic drainage. Please review the section of **SLEEP OPTIMIZATION** and ask your memory coach for guidance to make your sleep more restful and therapeutic. Sleep hygiene and hormone optimization should be at the top of your list! Please visit with your memory coach or primary care provider about **OVERNIGHT OXIMETRY SCREENING** or **SLEEP STUDY**.
- You have reported a history of restless sleep. Consider purchasing a **LOOKEE TECHâ¢** Sleep Oxygen Monitor. This self-monitoring device continuously tracks oxygen saturation levels and heart rate. It also gathers insight on movement during tracking and records data every four seconds, while awake or asleep.
- It is often difficult to visit a sleep lab and complete an overnight oximetry. However, for a nominal fee, you can purchase a self-monitoring device that you can use at home to predict the quality of your sleep. You can get regular and routine data without having to sleep at a sleep lab. Visit **www.lookeetech.com**
- You can bring all your questions about sleep disorders to Office Hours for more tips and guidance on supportive sleep.

**Have you ever wondered if you have obstructive sleep apnea? The Mallampati Score is a simple screening tool that can help you predict the integrity of your oral airway.**

Go in your bathroom and look in the mirror. Say "ahhhh," and inspect the opening in the back of your mouth. If your airway looks like a **class 3 or 4**, then you should assume you have **OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA** until screening or testing proves otherwise!
- **STRESS REDUCTION** is an essential way to rebalance and refresh. We offer clients several interventions to lower stress and revitalize the mind. Interventions include audio-visual entrainment, red and **NIR** light therapy, **PEMF** therapy, far-infrared sauna, **LiveO2â¢**, **Inner Balanceâ¢** and **Emwave2â¢** breathing trainers, and a myriad of other interventions. Your memory coach can help you to identify interventions most likely to support your needs.
- **SUPPLEMENTS HELP RESTORE OPTIMAL LEVELS OF ESSENTIAL NUTRIENTS** - A powerful advantage of The Enhance Protocolâ¢ is to personalize your supplement recommendations based on your medical history, social history, and your laboratory results. Additional supplement recommendations not associated with lab work will be discussed in the next section called **NOOTROPICS**.

**DON'T LET ALCOHOL KEEP YOU FROM REACHING YOUR BRAIN HEALTH GOALS!**
- Did you know that **ALCOHOL IS A NEUROTOXIN**? In your history, you listed the moderate use of **ALCOHOL**. The clichÃ© of our day is "everything in moderation." However, when you view **ALCOHOL** as recognized neurotoxin, the argument is completely bogus! Even if your **ALCOHOL** use is infrequent or used in small quantities, do you really want to consume a "moderate" amount of neurotoxin? **ALCOHOL** has far more disadvantages than advantages.
- **ALCOHOL** is an "inflammogen," and when consumed in small quantities, it can exacerbate inflammatory pathways in the body. Though you may drink very little, in many "at-risk" clients, even mild consumption can exacerbate epigenetic expression.
- **ALCOHOL** messes up your sleep and ignites progressive inflammatory process in the liver and **GI** tract.
- The early impact of **ALCOHOL** consumption is **INTOXICATION**. The late impact is a contribution to systemic inflammation, increased oxidative stress, impaired detoxification, and often neurodegenerative disease.
- If you joined The Enhance Protocolâ¢ because you have risk for neurodegenerative disease, please consider complete abstinence from **ALCOHOL** as one of the lifestyle interventions you choose to utilize to improve your brain health.
- Please attend Office Hours and bring up your questions about **ALCOHOL**. This is a common question, and it often stimulates excellent online group discussion.
